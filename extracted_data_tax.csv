0,"When a person dies, their property passes to their personal representative. This is usually a close family member. The personal representative then distributes the deceased’s person’s assets (money, possessions and property) in accordance with the law, the will - if there is one - or the laws of intestacy if there is no will. These assets are described as the deceased person’s estate . You may need access to some of the deceased person's money to pay for funeral expenses. Many banks have arrangements in place to help pay for funeral expenses from the deceased person’s account (you should contact the bank to find out more). You may also need to get access for living expenses, at least until a social welfare payment is awarded. There is a range of payments provided by the Department of Social Protection (DSP) that are available to help families during this difficult time.",882
1,"If money is held in the deceased person’s name only, then family members usually cannot get access until probate is granted to the personal representative. But if the amount in an account is small, the bank may release it to the personal representative or the next of kin. Bank accounts in joint names If the bank account is in the joint names of your loved one and their spouse or civil partner, the money can usually be transferred into the surviving spouse or civil partner’s name. You will need the death certificate to do this. If the bank account is in the joint names of the deceased person and someone else, and the bank was given instructions when the account was opened that the other person was to receive the money on the death of the deceased, the money can be transferred into the survivor’s name. If there is an account with more than €50,000, you will also need a letter of clearance from Revenue allowing the money to be transferred to the surviving account holder, pending investigations about Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT). CAT is a form of inheritance tax. Spouses and civil partners are not liable for CAT on inheritances from each other. If you think the deceased person may have had a dormant bank account , you should contact the financial institution at which the account was held. If that financial institution no longer exists and you want to find out where to make your enquiry or claim, you should contact the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI).",1487

Kerry, V93 WN9T. If they had other state savings, you should notify An Post .",403
3,"If the deceased person had a credit union account and completed a valid nomination form when opening the account, the money in the account, up to a maximum of €23,000, goes to the nominated person or persons.

If there is no named beneficiary, then the proceeds form part of the overall estate of the deceased and are distributed with the other assets. Find out about different types of insurance here .",335
5,"The rules governing occupational pensions and personal pensions depend on the terms of the pension. If your loved one was a member of a pension scheme, you should contact the scheme administrators to find out if there is a pension for the spouse, civil partner and/or children. Self-employed people may have pension arrangements that involve some of the investments becoming part of the estate when the person dies. Divorced people and people whose civil partnership has been dissolved may have access to some part of the pension scheme depending on whether a pension adjustment order was made at the time of the divorce or dissolution.",636

9,"When a person close to you dies, it can feel overwhelming. You may find it difficult to focus on practical things like accessing money and applying for financial help. For many people, the loss of a loved one can lead to a decrease in the amount of money that is available to support you and your family. Help is available . This page has information on some of financial issues you might have to deal with following a bereavement.

You do this by sending a death certificate (if you have one) or a death notice from a newspaper to the section of the DSP that was paying them . There are also payments provided by the Department of Social Protection that are available to assist families with funeral costs. You may also be entitled to a death related benefit (for example, a Widow’s, Widower’s or Surviving Civil Partner’s Pension). Tax There are rules about income tax in the year of a person's death.

11,"You may be concerned that your loved one left behind debts that have to be repaid. Personal loans, credit cards and overdrafts You are only responsible for those debts that you yourself have signed for. If you are having difficulty making repayments on a loan in your own name or in joint names, you should let the company know what has happened and ask for time to work out what you can afford, given your changed circumstances. Repayments on a loan in the sole name of your loved one should be paid out of the estate. If you are asked to take over payments on a loan that is in the sole name of your loved one, you do not have to do this. Get advice if you are not sure what to do. MABS provide free, confidential and independent advice on a range of financial matters. You can contact MABS on 0818 07 2000, 9am to 8pm, Monday to Friday. Credit cards, bank overdrafts and personal loans are known as ‘unsecured debts’. With unsecured debt, the creditor (the institution that is owed) does not have the right to take a particular item of property if the debtor does not pay. These debts are repaid from the estate. You only have to repay debts yourself if they were taken out in joint names. If there is not enough money in the estate to repay unsecured debts that were taken out solely by the person who has died, and the debts are not covered by an insurance policy, the creditor cannot ask anyone else to repay the debt. Mortgages If you have a mortgage that was taken out with your loved one, you should check if repayments are covered by mortgage protection insurance . If it is not covered, then you have to continue repaying the mortgage. If you have difficulty in paying, you should talk to your mortgage provider. You can also get advice from MABS.",1758
12,"When a person dies, their property, known as their estate, passes to their personal representative. The personal representative then has the duty to distribute the deceased person’s money and property in accordance with the will (if there is a will) or the laws of succession if there is no will. If your deceased spouse or civil partner made a will, you have an automatic right to a share in the estate which is called a ‘ legal right share ’. If you are separated your inheritance rights may have been renounced or extinguished. If you are divorced from the person who died, or your civil partnership was dissolved, you no longer automatically inherit from the estate. Cohabiting couples in Ireland have no automatic right of inheritance on the death of either partner, but you can apply to the courts for provision to be made for you from the estate.",853

Under the revised VRT system the CO2 emissions of a car will replace engine size as the criterion to determine the VRT rate payable on the car at point of registration. Lower emission cars will attract reduced VRT rates and higher emission cars will be liable to higher rates. The VRT rates will continue to be applied to the Open Market Selling Price of the car.

118,"National minimum wage The national minimum wage rate is to be reduced by €1 per hour as stated in the Memorandum of Understanding of the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland . This reduced rate will not apply to existing employees as a reduction in their wages would be a change to their terms and conditions of employment .

Three-year tax exemption for start-up companies This scheme is being extended to include start-up companies which start a new trade in 2011. The scheme is being modified so that the value of the relief will be linked to the amount of employers’ PRSI paid by a company in an accounting period subject to a maximum of €5,000 per employee. If the amount of qualifying employers’ PRSI is lower than the reduction in corporation tax liability otherwise applicable, relief will be based on the lower amount The Business Expansion Scheme will be transformed into the Employment and Investment Incentive with an increase in the amount that companies can raise under the scheme. Employment-related tax reliefs abolished from 1 January 2011 Tax relief for trade union subscriptions The tax exemption from Benefit in Kind (BIK) for employer provided     childcare Tax relief on subscriptions to professional bodies Approved Share Options Scheme, effective from the launch of the National     Recovery Plan on 24 November 2010 Tax relief for new shares purchased by employees Labour market activation Refocus the National Employment Action Plan to provide opportunities for     education, training and work experience placements Additional 15,000 activation places and supports for the unemployed Extension of Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive Scheme to end 2011 Pensions Social welfare pensions There will be no change to social welfare pension rates.

Maximum allowable pension funds The maximum allowable pension fund on retirement for tax purposes (known as the Standard Fund Threshold (SFT)), is to be set at €2.3 million with effect from 7 December 2010. A higher threshold may apply if, on 7 December 2010, the capital value of an individual’s pension rights drawn down on or after 7 December 2005 (i.e. crystallised pension rights) when added to any uncrystallised pension rights the individual may have, as valued on 7 December 2010, are greater than €2.3 million and lower than €5,418,085 which is the current value of the SFT. This change will apply with effect from 1 January 2011. Approved Retirement Funds The annual imputed distribution which applies to the value of assets in an Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) at 31 December each year is being increased from 3% to 5% in respect of asset values at 31 December 2010 and future years.

Lump sums over €200,000 will be taxed at the standard income tax rate (currently 20%) up to €575,000 (25% of the new Standard Fund Threshold). Anything over this amount will be taxed at the taxpayer’s marginal rate of income tax. Tax-free retirement lump sums taken on or after 7 December 2005 will count towards “using up” the new tax free amount so that if a person has already taken tax free retirement lump sums of €200,000 or more since 7 December 2005, any further retirement lump sums paid to them on or after 1 January 2011 will be taxable. These earlier lump sums will also count towards determining how much of a lump sum paid on or after Budget day is to be charged at the standard or marginal tax rate. This change will apply with effect from 1 January 2011. Extension of flexible options on retirement All members of defined contribution pension arrangements will have access to flexible options on retirement in respect of the main benefits arising from those schemes, subject to certain conditions.

Tenant Purchase Scheme A higher discount is being introduced in the short term for existing local authority tenants who wish to purchase their homes under the Tenant Purchase Scheme. Household charge A flat rate “household charge” will be introduced in 2012 as an interim measure. It will be followed in 2013 by a final Site Value Tax, which will be introduced when valuations have been completed.

Growth Incentive Scheme for airlines The Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) is to introduce a new Growth Incentive Scheme for airlines operating at Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports. The Scheme, which will provide a full rebate of airport charges in respect of traffic at all three airports above an annual threshold of €23.5m, is to encourage overall traffic passenger growth at the airports.

120,"School transport The school transport charge for post-primary students increases by €50 to €350 per year, with a maximum charge of €650 per family. A new charge of €50 is introduced for primary school pupils, except for medical card holders , with a maximum charge of €110 per family. The charges are subject to an overall maximum charge of €650 per family. For the school year 2011/2012, the distance criteria will be applied to all pupils attending primary schools. This means that children who live less than 3.2 kilometres (2 miles) from school, and who get free transport under the “closed school” rule at present, will lose their transport eligibility. Services for very small numbers of pupils will be discontinued. A minimum of 10 eligible children (up from 7 at present) will be required to establish or retain services. Further changes arising from the recent Value for Money review will take effect from a later date. Capitation grants There is a 5% reduction in all capitation grants, including grants for adult literacy, community education, the School Completion Programme and Youthreach. Student charges The Student Services Charge for third-level students is replaced by a flat-rate higher education student contribution of €2,000 per year. Arrangements will be made to provide that second and subsequent siblings from a single family will not have to bear the full increased cost of the new €2,000 charge. It is intended that this contribution will be payable in two instalments. Students qualifying for third-level grants will not have to pay it. A new charge of €200 per year is introduced for Post-Leaving Certificate (PLC) students. Students qualifying for maintenance grants will not have to pay this charge.

The benefits payable to mature students will be limited to those payable to ordinary students. Mature students will no longer be automatically eligible for the non-adjacent rate of grant. The proportion of students qualifying for the non-adjacent rate of grant will be reduced by changing the qualifying distance between the student’s home and college from 24km to 45km. It is expected that these changes will take effect from the 2011/2012 academic year. Funding of third-level institutions There is a 5% cut in the non-pay grant to institutions such as universities and institutes of technology. Education for Travellers Senior Traveller Training Centres (STTCs) will be phased out by June 2012. Replacement further education places, prioritised for Travellers, will be provided under the Back to Education Initiative (BTEI). This means that there will be no new enrolments in STTCs from 1 January 2011. National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) The number of psychologists employed by NEPS will be capped at the current level of 178. FÁS payments All weekly training allowances and similar support payments paid through FÁS are reduced by €8 in line with the reductions in all Department of Social Protection (DSP) working-age payments. The long-term unemployment bonus paid to students on the Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) is reduced from €31.80 to €20 per week. Labour market activation programmes The National Employment Action Plan will be refocused to establish clearer pathways to employment by ensuring that State agencies interact early and often with those who have lost their jobs to provide opportunities for education, training or work experience placements as appropriate. An additional 15,000 activation places and supports for the unemployed will be provided under the following programmes: A new Skills Development and Internship Programme will provide up to     5,000 places in the private sector. The Work Placement Programme will provide up to 5,000 places in the     public service. The scheme was recently extended in the Education sector     and will be extended further within other sectors over the coming   months. A new Community Work Placement Scheme will provide up to 5,000 additional     places in the community and voluntary sector. Participants will work 19.5     hours a week for 12 months and their rate of payment will be the maximum     rate of their social welfare payment plus a weekly €20 top up. Health Hospital charges There are no increases in the Accident and Emergency (A&E) charge, the statutory day and inpatient charges, or the monthly threshold for the Drug Payment Scheme.

This is to meet anticipated extra demand for emergency residential, respite and personal assistant/home support hours for people with disabilities and day places for school leavers in September 2011. An additional €1m has been provided for suicide prevention. The National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) will target: Development of the number and range of training and awareness   programmes Improvements and standardised responses to deliberate self harm Development of the capacity of primary care to respond to suicidal     behaviour and consider new models of response Ensuring that helpline supports for those in emotional distress are     coordinated and widely publicised Older people Additional funding of €8m for Home Care Packages for approximately 500 extra recipients at any one time, or up to 800 during the year 2011. An additional €6m for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Fair Deal Scheme) was announced. This funding takes account of the increasing number of older people that require long-term nursing home care due to demographic trends. Miscellaneous Public service The Taoiseach’s salary will be reduced by €14,000, that of the Tánaiste by €11,000 and the salaries of Ministers by €10,000. The system of State cars will be reformed to include a pool system for Ministers based in Dublin. Ex- office holders, such as former Taoisigh will also have a pooling arrangement. One of the two Government jets will be disposed of. New entrants to the public service will start at the lowest point of the revised pay scale. This scale is 10% lower than that currently in operation. In future, there will be a cap of €250,000 on salaries in the public service and in semi-State organisations. There will be cuts in all public service pensions. The cuts will apply to existing beneficiaries.",2227

124,"Income tax There are no changes in the existing rates or income tax bands. There are also no changes to existing tax credits. However, Illness Benefit will now be taxed from the first day of payment; previously the first 6 weeks (36 days) were exempt from tax. Domicile levy The Irish citizenship condition for payment of the levy is being removed. This will mean that liable non-residents will not be able to avoid the levy by changing their citizenship status. Universal Social Charge (USC) People with an income of less than €10,036 will no longer pay the Universal Social Charge. Currently, people with an income below €4,004 do not pay USC. PRSI The current relief of 50% of employer PRSI for employee contributions to pension schemes has been abolished.

Value-Added Tax (VAT) The standard rate of VAT will be increased from 21% to 23% from 1 January 2012. This only affects goods which are already liable to the 21% rate. The rate of VAT will be reduced from 21% to 13.5% on district heating, for example, where heating is supplied from a central source to a number of business premises within a building. This brings this form of heating in line with other energy suppliers. Open farms will be liable to charge VAT at 9% on admission fees from 1 January 2012. DIRT (Deposit Interest Retention Tax) DIRT will be increased from 27% to 30% for payments made annually or more frequently.

Find out more about the impact of this change on page 21 of the Taxation Annexes document (pdf) . The increase will apply from 1 May 2012 to kerosene, Marked Gas Oil, Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG), fuel oil and natural gas. (This is to take account of the effect the increase would have on home heating costs over the winter months.) The carbon tax will not apply to solid fuels, so there will be no increases for peat or coal. Betting duty It is proposed to extend betting duty of 1% to remote betting and to introduce a betting intermediaries’ duty (Gross Profits Tax of 15%) to cover betting exchanges. This provision is being legislated for in the Betting (Amendment) Bill. Following publication of the Bill there is a legal requirement to notify the EU Commission 3 months before enactment of the Bill. It is intended that the new taxation regime will commence from the second quarter of 2012. Property taxes Household charge A household charge of €100 is being introduced in 2012. This charge will fund local services, in line with the requirement in the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland. The charge is an interim measure pending design and implementation of a full property tax in 2014. Homeowners (not tenants) will be liable for the household charge. The charge does not apply to social housing or housing provided by a charity. There will be a waiver for those on Mortgage Interest Supplement and for those residing in certain categories of unfinished housing estates. Provision will also be made to allow payment of the charge in instalments. Mortgage interest relief (MIR) Mortgage interest relief will no longer be available to house purchasers who purchase after the end of 2012 and will be fully abolished from 2018, as previously announced. First time buyers in 2012 will get mortgage interest relief at 25% for the first two years, 22.5% for years 3 and 4 and 20% for years 6 and 7.

Pensions Approved Retirement Funds The tax on the value of assets in an Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) at 31 December each year is being increased from 5% to 6% for ARFs with asset values over €2 million. This also applies where an individual owns more than one ARF, where the aggregate value of the assets in those ARFs exceeds €2 million. (31 December 2012 and future years) It is proposed to apply a higher final liability tax rate of 30% to the transfer of transfer of ARF assets on the death of an ARF owner to a child of the owner aged over 21. The details of this will be published in the Finance Bill. Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) The provisions which apply to ARFs will also apply on the same basis to 'vested' PRSAs, where the assets are retained in the PRSA rather than being transferred to an ARF. This includes an increased deemed distribution percentage of 6% for vested PRSAs with assets in excess of €2 million. Further details will be published in the Finance Bill.

It is being extended to include companies which start up in 2012, 2013 or 2014. Farmers Stock relief for registered farm partnerships An enhanced 50% stock relief (100% for certain young trained farmers) for registered farm partnerships is being introduced and will run until 31 December 2015 subject to clearance with the European Commission under State Aid rules. Measures to incentivise timely farm transfers Full retirement relief from CGT for intra-family transfers will be maintained for individuals aged 55 to 66. An upper limit of €3m on retirement relief is introduced for business and farming assets disposed of within the family (where the individual transferring the assets is aged over 66 years). This will incentivise earlier transfer of farms. (The current unlimited amount applies for a transitional period of 2 years for individuals currently aged 66 or who reach that age before 31 December 2013.) The current upper limit of €750,000 for assets transferred outside the family for individuals aged between 55 and 66 years will be maintained. The upper limit for retirement relief for business and farming assets transferred outside the family is reduced from €750,000 to €500,000 for individuals aged over 66 years.

Full details of these measures will be set out in the Finance Bill.",10077
125,"People of working age There will be no changes to weekly rates of social welfare payments. Jobseeker’s Benefit and Allowance Where a Jobseeker's Benefit recipient is working for part of a week, the payment entitlement will be based on a 5-day week rather than a 6-day week. This means that for each day that a person is unemployed, one-fifth of the normal rate of Jobseeker's Benefit is payable and if they get part-time work for 2 days, they will get three-fifths of the normal Jobseeker's Benefit for that week. (July 2012) Sunday working will be taken into account when calculating the amount of Jobseeker's Benefit or Jobseeker's Allowance to be paid. (January 2013) One-Parent Family Payment The upper age limit of the youngest child for new claimants will be reduced to 12 years in 2012. (It is currently 14 years for new claimants.) It will be reduced further to 7 years on a phased basis in following years. The means test for OFP is being amended: The amount of earnings disregarded in the One-Parent Family Payment means     test will be reduced from €146.50 to €130.00 per week in 2012 for new     and existing recipients. Half the weekly earnings in excess of this amount     will also be disregarded. (January 2012) Further reductions will be introduced over the following 4 years: to     €110 in 2013, €90 in 2014, €75 in 2015 and €60 in 2016. The temporary payment of half the One-Parent Family Payment rate where     the recipient's earnings exceed €425 per week will be discontinued.     Existing recipients of the temporary payment will not be affected. (January     2012) People getting One-Parent Family Payment can get half-rate Jobseeker’s Benefit, Illness Benefit or Incapacity Supplement if they satisfy the qualifying conditions. These half-rate payments will cease for applicants for Jobseeker’s Benefit, Illness Benefit and Incapacity Supplement. (January 2012) Farm Assist The rate of payment will not change.

If a person is on a Community Employment scheme and One-Parent Family Payment, Deserted Wife’s Allowance or Benefit or a widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension, payment of 2 qualified child increases will cease for both new and existing recipients. The training and materials grant for Community Employment will reduce from €1,500 to €500 per participant per annum.

The rate for the third child will be €148 and for the fourth and each subsequent child will be €160. (January 2012) The additional monthly payment for twins and triplets will be maintained but the grant of €635 paid at birth, at 4 years of age and at 12 years of age for these multiple births will cease. (January 2012)",3910

(July 2012) Payment of 2 qualified child increases where the person is on a Community Employment Scheme and One Parent Family Payment, Deserted Wife’s Allowance/Benefit or Widow(er)’s Pensions will cease for new and existing recipients. Carers Carer's Allowance New applicants for Carer’s Allowance, who are not living with the person for whom they are providing care, will not be entitled to the Household Benefits package. The person receiving care may be entitled to the Household Benefits package in their own right. (April 2012) Carer’s Allowance weekly rates of payment will not change. The half-rate Carer’s Allowance will continue to be paid to people who are full-time carers and who are getting another welfare payment. The extra payment for caring for more than one person is retained. Carers will continue to get the annual Respite Care Grant of €1,700 for each care recipient. People with disabilities Disability Allowance The age of entitlement for Disability Allowance will increase to 18 years in line with other social welfare payments. The age of entitlement for Domiciliary Care Allowance will be extended from 16 years to 18 years of age. (This measure was announced on 6 December. On 7 December it was announced that this measure is under review and may not be implemented.) For new claimants aged 18 to 24, the rates of payment for Disability Allowance will be aligned with Jobseeker's Allowance rates for that age group (€100 per week for people aged 18 to 21 and €144 per week for people aged 22 to 24). (This measure was announced on 6 December. On 7 December it was announced that this measure is under review and may not be implemented.) People who are aged under 25 years and are already getting a full-rate Disability Allowance payment will not be affected. If people under 25, who are currently getting Disability Allowance, take up opportunities for education or training (for example, by availing of the Back-to-Education scheme or Community Employment) or leave the country and subsequently revert to Disability Allowance, they will not be subject to the reduced rates. Disablement Benefit New applicants for Disablement Benefit must have a disability classified at more than 15% to qualify for the payment. (January 2012) Supplementary Welfare Allowance Rent Supplement The minimum contribution by single tenants towards rent for the purposes of the Rent Supplement scheme will be increased to €30 per week (from €24 per week).

This approach is consistent with the reports of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Group and the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Mortgage Arrears. (2012) People getting Mortgage Interest Supplement will be granted a waiver from the new €100 Household Charge. Fuel Allowance The Fuel Allowance season will be reduced by 6 weeks from 32 weeks to 26 weeks for all recipients (it will now be paid for 6 months from mid-October to mid-April). Treatment Benefit Scheme The frequency of the grant for hearing aids will change from 2 years to 4 years. (January 2012) The maximum grant available for 1 hearing aid will change from €760 to €500 and from €1,520 to €1,000 for 2 hearing aids. (January 2012) Older people There will be no change in the rates of State pensions or other payments for those aged over 66, for example, Living Alone Allowance, Household Benefits Scheme and Fuel Allowance. Changes to contributory State pensions Currently a person with an average of 20 - 47 PRSI contributions per year over their working life receives a weekly State pension of €4.50 less than a person with a yearly average of 48 or more PRSI contributions. A lower pension will be payable to new applicants for State pension who have a yearly average of less than 48 PRSI contributions. (September 2012) Currently, late claims for certain contributory pensions can be backdated on a reducing scale for up to 5 years. This backdating period will be reduced to a maximum of 6 months. This applies to State Pension (Contributory and Transition), Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension and Widow(er)'s Contributory Pension. (April 2012) Widow(er)’s Contributory Pension and Surviving Civil Partner’s Contributory Pension New applicants for Widow(er)'s Contributory Pension and Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension will need a higher total number of paid PRSI contributions to qualify. The number of paid contributions required will increase from 156 to 260 contributions from December 2013. Half-rate payments People getting Widow(er)’s Pension, Surviving Civil Partner’s Pension or One-Parent Family Payment can get half-rate Jobseeker’s Benefit, Illness Benefit or Incapacity Supplement if they satisfy the qualifying conditions. These half-rate payments will cease for applicants for Jobseeker’s Benefit, Illness Benefit and Incapacity Supplement. (January 2012) Means testing for social assistance payments For new and existing claimants, income from employment as a home help funded by the Health Service Executive (HSE) will be assessed in means tests for social assistance payments. The existing earnings disregards for the relevant social welfare payment will apply. (January 2012) Income from weekly Carer’s Benefit and Carer’s Allowances will be included when calculating entitlement to Family Income Supplement in line with other welfare payments. (January 2012 for new applicants and on renewal for all others) The amount of earnings disregarded for the purposes of the One-Parent Family Payment means test will be reduced from €146.50 to €130.00 per week in 2012 for new and existing recipients. Further reductions will be introduced over the following 4 years. (January 2012) The temporary payment of half of the rate of One Parent Family Payment where the recipient's earnings exceed €425 per week will be discontinued. Existing recipients of the temporary payment will not be affected. (January 2012) Other savings The cost of medical certificates for illness and disability related schemes will be reduced by 10%. This is an administrative saving in the Department of Social Protection. Savings will be achieved on the Electricity Allowance. Enforcement / compliance Revenue will continue to obtain information on payments made by other Government bodies (in particular the Department of Social Protection) to allow Revenue to cross check the status of individuals and improve its collection.

Action Plan for Jobs The Government recently committed to deliver a multi-annual Action Plan for Jobs, with quarterly targets for delivery every year and a monitoring group to oversee implementation. The Action Plan for Jobs will address 7 principal areas: Improving competitiveness and intensifying competition in sheltered     sectors Supporting indigenous start-ups Assisting indigenous business to grow Attracting inward entrepreneurial start-ups Developing and deepening the impact of Foreign Direct Investment Developing employment initiatives within the community Exploiting sectoral opportunities, identified as priorities A Micro Finance Loan Fund, to provide loans on a commercial basis for start-up businesses and micro-enterprises will operate from early 2012. It is expected that the businesses that will primarily benefit will be those at the margins of commercial lending decisions. The Temporary Partial Loan Guarantee Scheme is expected to be in place in the first quarter of 2012. Under the Scheme, the Government will partially guarantee loans by traditional lenders to viable businesses that are at the margins of commercial lending decisions and have difficulties accessing credit.

The Government will shortly publish a policy statement, Pathways to Work , which will set out its strategy to reform labour market activation policy to prevent the drift into, and help the reduction of, long-term unemployment. Administrative efficiencies/rationalisation The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation’s Comprehensive Review of Expenditure led to the following key outcomes: Implementation of changes to business process aimed at delivering     services more efficiently The streamlining of the State’s employment rights bodies (i.e. the     Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the     Employment Appeals Tribunal, the Equality Tribunal and the Labour Court)     will create a single entry point for all users of the employment rights     machinery Greater utilisation of eGovernment tools in the Companies Registration     Office A strong commitment to the public service reform agenda, in particular in     the areas of shared services and outsourcing models in appropriate cases,     including high-volume case processing operations Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) In addition to the Loan Guarantee Fund and Micro Finance Fund, there will be the following targeted measures for the SME sector: The first €100,000 of R&D expenditure of all companies will be     allowed on a volume basis for the purpose of the R&D Tax Credit The outsourcing arrangements for R&D purposes will be improved in a     targeted manner to allow the greater of the existing percentage arrangement     or €100,000 Companies will have the option to use some portion of the R&D credit     to reward key employees who have been involved in the development of   R&D The corporate tax exemption for new start-up companies is being extended     for the next three years and will be available for companies that commence     trading in 2012, 2013 and 2014 Smaller companies will also be able to avail of the planned foreign     earnings deduction where they plan to expand their export markets into the     BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa).

Existing claimants will not be affected. Illness Benefit From 6 January 2014 no Illness Benefit payment will be made for the first 6 days of illness (up from 3 days). This means that a person will not be entitled to Illness Benefit for the first 6 days of their claim. Rent and Mortgage Interest Supplements From January 2014 the minimum contribution towards Rent Supplement and Mortgage Interest Supplement for couples will be increased by €5 per week, from €35 to €40.

Invalidity Pension The higher weekly Invalidity Pension rate of €230.30 paid when claimants reach age 65 will be discontinued. The rate payable to people aged 65 (and under) will be €193.50 per week. It will apply to people claiming Invalidity Pension who reach their 65th birthday from 2 January 2014. Existing 65 year olds are unaffected. This measure is being undertaken in line with the abolition of the State Pension (Transition) from January 2014. People who are getting Invalidity Pension (existing and new recipients) will continue to be automatically transferred to State Pension (Contributory) at age 66 and they will receive a weekly rate of €230.30.

Local Enterprise Offices will get additional funding of €3.5 million for investment in supports for start-ups and growing businesses. Trading-online voucher scheme : In 2014 €5 million will be provided to assist the rollout of a national trading-online voucher scheme, aimed at getting 2,000 small Irish businesses trading online. Under a pilot scheme being launched in October 2013, vouchers of up to €2,500 will be provided to 50 small companies to help them develop an online trading presence. The scheme will be administered by the Dublin City Enterprise Board and will target small enterprises that employ fewer than 10 people and have a turnover of less than €2m per annum. Credit Review Office : the threshold for credit applications that can be reviewed by the Credit Review Office is being increased from €500,000 to €3 million. The VAT cash threshold for small and medium enterprises will increase from €1.25 million to €2 million with effect from 1 May 2014. A new SME Communications Strategy will aim to increase awareness of State supports amongst small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and to ensure that there is a greater awareness amongst businesses of the Credit Guarantee Scheme, which will soon be re-launched. A new Building Business Capacity programme, consisting of 2 days dedicated off-site training and expert mentoring support, will aim to enhance the business and financial capacity of SMEs in relation to understanding and using a broader range of financial products, as well as equipping them with tools needed to make a strong business case when applying for credit. The programme will be launched on a pilot basis, with 1,000 SMEs expected to take part in 2014.

Capital Gains Tax : A new relief from Capital Gains Tax is being introduced to encourage entrepreneurs who reinvest the proceeds from the disposal of assets, on which CGT has previously been paid, into a new investment in productive trading activities. The measure will apply where someone who has already paid CGT on the disposal of assets invests in a new business in the period 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2018 and subsequently disposes of this investment no earlier than three years after the date of investment. The relief will be a tax credit equal to (i) the lower of the CGT paid on the previous asset disposal or (ii) 50% of the CGT due on any gain from the future disposal of the new investment. EU state-aid approval is required for this measure. Employment and Investment Incentive : The initial 30% relief available for investments under the Employment and Investment Incentive (EII) is being removed from the high earners restriction for a period of 3 years. This restriction limits the amount of tax reliefs that can be claimed by high income individuals. The EII provides that a maximum of €150,000 can be invested by an individual per annum. Therefore, by lifting the restriction on the initial 30% relief, these investors should be encouraged to invest more funds in the EII and improve the availability of funds to SMEs.

The membership elects individual members to the board of directors of the credit union. The board members are unpaid volunteers and they set the policies under which the credit union operates. There are two main umbrella bodies for credit unions - the Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU) and the Credit Union Development Association (CUDA) .

The credit union may require security for the loan – this depends on the credit union’s own rules. The minimum and maximum loan amount is set locally by each credit union. The maximum repayment term on unsecured loans is 10 years and on unsecured loans is 35 years. Your ability to repay the loan is the main consideration taken into account when you make a loan application. Each loan application is assessed on an individual basis, in line with lending regulations and the credit union’s lending policy. The credit union must have an appeals process in place for a member who is refused a loan. The rate of interest charged on the loans is decided by the board of directors. The interest on the loan may not be more than 1% per month. Some credit unions offer the It Makes Sense loan, which provides small loans at low interest rates. The loan may be available if you are getting a social welfare payment and are having difficulty getting credit from other sources.

The Central Bank has the power to impose conditions on the registration of a credit union. These conditions may be appealed to the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal . Regulatory decisions may also be appealed to this tribunal. The main function of the Registrar of Credit Unions is to regulate credit unions to: Protect members' savings in each credit union Maintain the financial stability and wellbeing of credit unions   generally Credit unions who want to engage in certain types of business, for example, insurance, investment intermediary, and certain payment services must get authorisation from the Central Bank.

Governance The board of directors of the credit union makes the main decisions about its activities and oversees the management’s day-to-day operation of the business of the union. The board is not involved in direct management. The board makes decisions in relation to the following: Setting out strategy Making sure there is an effective management team in place Approving, reviewing and updating all plans, policies and procedures.

313,Money laundering is the processing of criminal proceeds (cash and assets obtained from criminal activities) to disguise their illegal origin. It is a world-wide problem and governments have been taking major steps in recent years to combat it. Money laundering has been treated as a very serious offence since the passing of the Criminal Justice Act in 1994 . The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Acts 2010 to 2021 updated Irish anti-money laundering and terrorist financing legislation and brought it in line with the requirements of EU legislation to prevent money laundering.

FIN-NET is a cross-border out-of-court complaints network and is made up of the existing national complaint schemes for financial services in Europe. FIN-NET handles disputes between consumers and financial services providers - that is banks, insurance companies, investments firms and others. If a consumer in one country has a dispute with a financial service provider in another country, FIN-NET members will put the consumer in touch with the relevant out-of court complaint scheme and provide the necessary information about it. FIN-NET aims to: Give you with easy and informed access to out-of-court redress in     cross-border disputes Make sure information is exchanged efficiently between European schemes Make sure that out-of-court dispute settlement schemes from different European     Economic Area countries apply with a common set of minimum guarantees     for consumers. FIN-NET decisions or recommendations are not enforceable in the same way as court decisions. However, in the majority of cases, financial institutions do follow the recommendations of the complaint body even if they are not binding.

If the FIN-NET member in your home country does not deal with the complaint, it will transfer it to the relevant scheme in your financial service provider's country. In some cases, it may be more efficient to contact the relevant complaints scheme directly and the FIN-NET member in your home country will ask you to do so. FIN-NET schemes aim to allow you to make your complaint at least in the language of your financial contract or the language in which you have usually dealt with your financial service provider. Member schemes of FIN-NET handle cross-border complaints with the same efficiency and the same level of care as they handle domestic complaints.

342,"If you owe money to someone, you are their debtor. The person (or the group of people or company) you owe money to is your creditor. They are entitled to ask you to pay your debts but they are not entitled to harass or intimidate you to pay. If you fail to pay a debt, your creditor is likely to go to court to get a judgment that you owe the debt. If the creditor gets a judgment against you, they are entitled to use various mechanisms to get the money from you. Read more in our document on enforcement of judgments . Legal aid Most court proceedings in relation to debt are civil proceedings . You may be eligible for civil legal aid if you pass the means test and if your case is likely to succeed. If you accept that you owe the debt and that you have no defence to the claim, then your case is unlikely to succeed and you would not get civil legal aid. If a judgment order is made against you, you are usually liable for the costs incurred by your creditor in taking the case. These costs are added to the amount of the judgment and can be enforced against you as part of the enforcement of the judgment. If you do not pay an instalment order and you are summonsed to court for committal proceedings, you are eligible for criminal legal aid . The decision on whether or not you get such aid is made by the judge dealing with the committal proceedings. The main function of committal proceedings under the Irish debt enforcement regime is to decide whether you should be imprisoned for any proven, deliberate failure to pay after a court order has been made to pay.",1571
343,"The proceedings are started by the person to whom you owe money. That person (or group of people or company) is the creditor and the claimant or plaintiff in the case. You are the debtor and the respondent or defendant in the case. The procedures and the documents which are used are different depending on which court is involved and sometimes depending on which kind of debt is involved. In general, you are served with documents that set out the details of what you owe. You then have an opportunity to defend the action. This means that you must issue a replying document arguing that you do not owe the money, or that the contract is not valid, or whatever legal defence is open to you. If you do not do anything, then the judgment will probably be awarded against you. In general, if you are served with a document starting legal proceedings, you have 3 options: You usually have a number of days in which to pay the debt and the     proceedings then do not start. The legal term is that the proceedings are     stayed. If you cannot pay what is owed and you have no defence, you can agree to     an order being made. If you intend to defend the action, you must serve the necessary replying     documents. Then a date is usually set for a hearing and the matter is     decided at the hearing. Initial notice If the matter in issue is covered by consumer credit legislation, then the person to whom you owe the money (the creditor) must issue a notice to you at least 10 days before taking legal action. This notice must outline: Details of the agreement The name and address of the creditor or owner Your name and address The term of the agreement to be enforced and A statement of the action the creditor intends to take to enforce the     agreement, including how and when they intend to take this action. If the consumer credit legislation does not apply, then it is the usual practice for creditors to send a 7-day demand letter to you before starting legal proceedings. This, however, is not a legal requirement. You, as the debtor, are generally liable for the costs of the court action.",2100
344,"Which of the courts in the Irish court system deals with the case depends on how much you owe. If you owe: Less than €15,000, the court proceedings must be brought in the     District Court Between €15,000 and €75,000, the court proceedings must be brought in     the Circuit Court If you owe more than €75,000, the court proceedings must be brought in     the High Court",371
345,"In general, the legal proceedings must be started in the District Court area where you live or where the contract was made. However, if the contract comes within the Consumer Credit Act 1995 , the proceedings may be brought only in the District Court area where you live. District Court proceedings are started when the creditor issues a claim notice to you. This notice states the creditor’s claim–for example, that you owe them €5,000 for goods bought on a specific date. You can read more about the process of issuing a claim notice in our document on District Court procedure. The notice gives you 2 options. You can: Pay the amount claimed within 10 days of the service of the claim notice     and avoid a court appearance or Dispute the claim by providing the claimant with a completed appearance     and defence form within 28 days of receiving the claim notice The claim notice must be served on you. The creditor must provide proof that the notice of claim form was served within the statutory timeframe. This can be done either by oral evidence to the court or by a statutory declaration of service . Any such documents must be lodged with the District Court Clerk at least 4 days before the court hearing. If you do not indicate that you intend to defend the proceedings, there is no hearing and the creditor gets a judgment that you owe the money. The creditor files with the District Court Clerk: An affidavit or statutory declaration of service of the claim notice. An affidavit is a written statement that is sworn to be true by the     person signing it. A certificate of no appearance or defence. An affidavit of debt verifying the creditor’s claim. A District Court decree. These documents constitute the District Court judgment set. These are then checked and, if all documents are in order, the judge of the District Court issues the judgment. The judgment is for the amount owed plus the costs involved in the proceedings. Having got the judgment, the creditor is then entitled to enforce the judgment . Interest at the rate of 2% begins to run on the amount of the judgment (but not the costs) from the day the judgment is given. If you defend the proceedings If you are defending the proceedings and have sent your form indicating your intention to defend, then the creditor must serve a notice of trial on you at least 10 days before the court hearing. At the hearing, the judge hears the arguments from the creditor and from you and makes a decision. That could be to make a judgment in favour of the creditor or to dismiss the action. If the judge considers that you cannot pay the amount through no fault of yours, the judge may elect to pause the enforcement of the court order for a period of time – this is known as a stay of execution . Alternatively, the judge may make an order for payment by instalments. If you do not defend the proceedings, there is no hearing so it is highly unlikely that a stay of execution or order of payment by instalments will be granted.",2998
346,"The procedure is broadly similar to that which applies in the District Court but there are some differences in the documents which are used. The rules are set out in the Circuit Court rules . The proceedings start with the creditor serving an ordinary civil bill on you. This is broadly similar to the claim notice used in the District Court. The claim being made by the creditor is set out in the indorsement of claim. This must set out the details such as the date and the content of the contract. The civil bill states that, if you want to defend the case, you must enter an appearance within 10 days. This period can be extended by agreement or by direction of the court. Entering an appearance means that you must lodge a specified form with the County Registrar and give a copy to the creditor or his solicitor. The County Registrar organises the business of the Circuit Court and has a broadly similar role to that of the Clerk of the District Court. If you do not propose to defend the action, you may consent to the claim. If you do not enter an appearance or if you enter an appearance and then do not deliver a defence, the creditor may apply to the court for a judgment in default of appearance . Such a judgment, providing for the amount owed plus costs, is given if the relevant documents are lodged by the creditor. Once the judgment has been granted, the creditor may then apply for an execution order to enforce the judgment.",1442
347,"Proceedings in the High Court are started by means of a summary summons . In general, this must be served in person unless that is not reasonably practical. However, there are other ways a summons can be served . The summary summons must include an indorsement of claim. This sets out the amount which the creditor claims is owed plus costs. It also states that, if you pay within 6 days, the proceedings will not go ahead (the proceedings are stayed). If the creditor is a licensed moneylender, this fact must be stated in the indorsement of claim. Other details about the loan agreement must also be stated, such as the applicable rate of interest. When you get a summary summons, you have 3 options: Pay the amount owed plus costs within 6 days and the proceedings will not     go ahead Consent to judgment and ask for further time for payment Defend the proceedings by entering     an appearance . You do this by delivering a memorandum in writing to the Central     Office of the High Court within 8 days of the service of the   summons. If you do not enter an appearance, the creditor may get judgment in default of appearance from the Central Office of the High Court. In some cases, for example, moneylending agreements, the permission of the Master of the High Court is required before such a judgment can be granted. If you do enter an appearance and defend the proceedings, then the case is heard by a High Court judge and judgment is given. Usually, the creditor looks for an order of fieri facias at the same time. This is a court order instructing a sheriff to obtain the amount of a money judgment out of the property of a judgment debtor.",1654

365,"When you die, all your assets are gathered together by your personal representative , that is your executor (if you had a will) or administrator (if you die without having made a will). The first duty of the personal representative is to pay your funeral and other expenses and then your debts. Insolvent estate Your estate is insolvent if your assets do not cover your: Funeral Testamentary and administration expenses (the expenses of dealing with     your estate) Debts and liabilities This is the case whether you had a will or died intestate (without a will). If you have no assets then payment of debts does not arise. Whatever assets you do have will be used to pay off your debts in the following order of priority: Funeral, testamentary and administration expenses Creditors who have security, for example, mortgage providers Preferential debts - these are mainly taxes and social insurance     contributions Ordinary debts, for example personal loans or credit cards Solvent estate A solvent estate is one where there are enough assets to pay the debts and the funeral and testamentary expenses. Where there are more assets than liabilities, your estate is solvent. However, if your assets are not sufficient to fulfil all of the wishes in your will, after paying the debts and expenses, your estate is solvent but not sufficient. If your estate is solvent, your funeral and other expenses and your debts must be paid first. If you die intestate (without making a will), the rest of your estate is then divided according to the rules on intestacy. If you have made a will but there will not be enough left after paying all of the debts and expenses to give the full gift to everyone, then there is a set order to which parts of the estate debts are paid from first: Property which you did not deal with in the will (that is, property which     would be distributed in accordance with the rules on intestacy) The residue - this is the amount left over when specific gifts are dealt     with Property specifically devoted for the payment of debts Property charged with the payment of debts Pecuniary legacies - these are gifts of money as distinct from property     or goods Other gifts When making your will, you can specify a different order for the payment of your debts. For an explanation of the debt terms on this page see our glossary of debt terms .",2365
366,"If you owe money to someone else, then you are a debtor and the other person is a creditor . If you fail to pay a debt, your creditor can go to court to get a judgment that you owe the debt. If your creditor has a judgment, it means they can now use different ways to get the money from you. This is called enforcing a judgment . The legal term is execution of the judgment. The creditor chooses how to enforce the judgment, and can use several different types of enforcement action at the same time. We explain these below. The Civil Debt (Procedures) Act 2015 will make changes in how debts can be enforced. It has not yet come into effect.",642
367,"In general, when the creditor has a judgment order from a court, the judgment can be enforced through an enforcement order. Enforcement orders can be issued by court offices – the creditor does not have to go back to court for the order. Creditors have 12 years from the date of the judgment order to look for enforcement orders. Enforcement orders are usually valid for one year and can then be renewed. If more than 6 years have passed since the judgment order was issued, a Leave of the court (the court’s permission) is needed to continue. What is a stay of execution? When a court pauses an enforcement for a period of time, it is known as stay of execution . A stay of execution may be granted, for example, if you can show that it is not your fault that you are unable to pay. You cannot get a stay of execution if you have not been engaging with the court process. What does registration of the judgment mean? By registering the judgment, the creditor makes it public that there is a judgment against you for not paying money you owe. Registering the judgment does not directly enforce the judgment. When it is made public, you are unlikely to be able to borrow more money. The creditor must tell you they plan to register the judgment before they register it. This gives you a chance to pay the debt. The creditor can register the court judgment in the Central Office of the High Court. Credit reference agencies publish lists of judgments that are consulted by banks (for example, in Stubbs Gazette and some newspapers). Main ways a creditor can enforce a judgment There are 4 main ways a creditor can enforce a judgment which we explain below: Execution against goods Instalment orders, followed by committal orders (if necessary) Attachment of earnings Judgment mortgage (see more about     home repossession ) Other ways of enforcing judgments include attachment of debts, appointment of a receiver and bankruptcy proceedings. These are rarely used for consumer debts. They are briefly explained in ‘Other methods of enforcing judgments’ below.",2057
368,Execution against goods means that the creditor gets an order from the court which directs the Sheriff or County Registrar to seize your goods. The goods are sold and the money raised used to pay the unpaid debt. This one of the main ways a creditor can enforce a judgment. It is sometimes called distress against goods. Execution against goods can have different forms in different courts.,390
369,"Sheriffs and County Registrars Sheriffs enforce judgments in Cork and Dublin. County Registrars enforce them in all other places. Sheriffs are self-employed people who are paid for their enforcement work on a commission basis. The fees they get are set out in law. Under the law, sheriffs currently receive various fixed fees and a scale of fees related to the amount involved in the enforcement. This is 5% of the first €5,500 and 2.5% of the balance. It also covers various expenses the sheriff has in the enforcement process. The current law is the Sheriff’s Fees and Expenses Order (SI 644/2005) made under the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1926 . County Registrars are civil servants whose main job is to organise the business of the Circuit Court in their areas. As well as County Sheriffs in Cork and Dublin, there are Revenue Sheriffs who enforce debts owed to Revenue. They have the power to collect tax debts. They do not need a court order to collect tax debts. Revenue Sheriffs have specific powers to make an instalment arrangement with you . Revenue debts can also be collected in the normal way if there is a court order. Seizing your goods The creditor can apply to court to have your financial circumstances examined to see what available assets you have that can be used to carry out the judgment. Powers of a Sheriff or Country Registrar The Sheriff or County Registrar does not have to give you notice of their intention to seize your property or goods. Their duty is to the creditor, so they cannot take your circumstances into account. The Sheriff or County Registrar has the power to go onto your property to take your goods. They must make reasonable efforts to do this peacefully. They are entitled to forcibly enter your property. The Sheriff or County Registrar must account to the court for the goods seized. If no goods are found, they make a return of nulla bona , literally meaning ""no goods"" . If the Sheriff or County Registrar does take your goods, they must give you an itemised and signed list of the goods seized. They must give you this list within 24 hours. They can then sell the goods by public auction. This can happen at any time from 2 days after the seizure. In practice, you are usually given warning of the sale. What a Sheriff or Country Registrar cannot do By law, the Sheriff or County Registrar cannot seize certain goods. They cannot take your necessary clothes and bedding and the tools of your trade, if the total value of such items is less than €19. In practice, goods with a low resale value are unlikely to be seized. They are likely to take electrical items, jewellery or your car (if you do not need it for work).",2675
370,"An instalment order is when you are ordered to repay the money you owe over a period of time in instalments that are judged affordable based on your circumstances. Your creditor can apply to the District Court in the district in which you live to have you attend the court in order to assess your financial situation and ability to pay. The judge may then order payment in full or payment in instalments, taking account of your financial situation. The instalment order procedure is mainly used by small creditors such as shops and credit unions. It can be used for judgments given in the District, Circuit or High Court. It is also used by creditors in family law proceedings, mainly for the enforcement of maintenance orders . If you are a family law debtor, your creditor can get an attachment of earnings order. An example of a family law debtor is if you have a maintenance order against you which has not been met. See below for more information on this process. Instalment orders are governed by the Enforcement of Court Orders Acts 1926 - 2009 and Order 53 of the District Court Rules . If you do not meet an instalment order If you do not meet the instalment order, the creditor may look for a committal order, which would send you to prison. Upcoming changes The Civil Debt (Procedures) Act 2015 abolishes the imprisonment of debtors for non-payment of civil debts. This has not yet come into effect. Current system Under current law, you may be imprisoned only if you can afford to pay debts but refuse to do so. The law that sets out the procedure for committal orders is the Enforcement of Court Orders (Amendment) Act 2009 . First, the creditor asks the District Court clerk to issue you a summons to appear at the District Court for a hearing. The summons must clearly set out: The options available to the judge at the hearing The consequences if you do not turn up in court, including the     possibility that you will be arrested or imprisoned Before the hearing, you must: Prepare a statement of means setting out your income and expenditure on a     weekly or monthly basis (Form: 51A.02) Lodge this statement with the court at least a week before the hearing is     due to take place At the hearing, both you and the creditor may give evidence. The creditor must prove beyond reasonable doubt that you have the ability to repay (means), but you are wilfully refusing to pay. The court has a number of options: It may change the instalment order. It may ask you to engage in mediation. The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) may be used for such mediation. It may make a committal order (for a maximum of 3 months). A committal     order is an order to the Gardaí for your arrest and imprisonment. This can     come into effect immediately, or at a later date. If you do not attend a hearing If you do not turn up, without a reasonable excuse, the judge can either adjourn the hearing or issue an arrest warrant. An arrest warrant orders the Gardaí to bring you before the court at the earliest opportunity. If you are later arrested and brought to court, a date is fixed for the hearing. The judge must make clear to you, in ordinary language: That you are entitled to apply for legal aid, and The consequences if you do not comply with the instalment order or do not     appear for the hearing on the date fixed – including going to prison The court has the power to grant you legal aid in line with the rules governing the criminal legal aid scheme .",3480
371,"This is when the money you owe is deducted straight from your wages by direct debit. The creditor seeks an order from court which is then served on the debtor’s employer, who sets up a direct debit. Attachment of earnings is currently only used for orders of maintenance of spouses and children . Under the Civil Debt (Procedures) Act 2015 (not yet in effect) creditors will be allowed use attachment of earnings or deductions from social welfare payments as an enforcement action for other types of debts. It will follow the same process as above. This legislation will apply to debts where: The value of the debt is between €500 and €4,000 There is a court judgment to recover the debt",687
372,"Judgment mortgage The creditor may register a charge against property owned by you. The effect is the same as taking out a mortgage. You have to pay off the judgment mortgage when the property is sold. Read more about home repossession . Attachment of a debt, or garnishee order If you owe money to a creditor and another person owes money to you, then your creditor can get a court order directing that person to pay the money directly to the creditor. This is known as a garnishee order . Generally, it is used only where there are no goods to be seized to be offset against the judgment. It is relatively rarely used in cases of consumer debt. Revenue has specific powers of attachment which can be exercised without a court order. Appointment of a receiver A receiver may be appointed over some of your assets or over future income such as rents, income of a trust fund or a pension. The law in this area is complex, but it seems that a receiver cannot be appointed over future earnings. Bankruptcy If you are unable to pay your debts, you can apply to the High Court to be declared bankrupt. Alternatively, your creditor may apply to have you declared bankrupt if certain conditions are met. Read more about bankruptcy .",1225
373,"This glossary contains some of the main terms used in connection with problem debt and personal insolvency. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) also explains terms related to debt in the CCPC jargon buster . Abhaile Scheme Abhaile is a free scheme providing a comprehensive range of expert supports to homeowners who are in mortgage arrears and at risk of losing their homes. The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) acts as the gateway to providing this service. Read more in our document on Abhaile . Approved Intermediary An approved intermediary is a person authorised by the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) to support a debtor to make an application for a Debt Relief Notice (DRN) . Arrears Arrears is a debt or payment that is not paid by the due date, or another term for missed payments. Bankruptcy Bankruptcy is a settlement of the debts of someone who is wholly or partially unable to repay their debts. It deals with both secured and unsecured debt. The purpose of the bankruptcy is to distribute your assets fairly among your creditors and protect you from these creditors . The distribution is done through a court official, the Official Assignee in Bankruptcy. Read more in our document on bankruptcy . Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) The CCMA is a statutory code, issued by the Central Bank of Ireland, which requires mortgage lenders to adopt specific procedures when dealing with borrowers who are facing mortgage arrears . Under this Code, each lender must have a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) . Read more in our document on Consumer protection codes and mortgages . Consolidation Loan A consolidation loan is a new, single loan that combines (consolidates) more than one outstanding debt. For example, a consolidation loan could combine your credit card debt, mortgage or rent arrears, loan repayments and household bills into one monthly payment. Consumer credit agreements A consumer credit agreement is a document that records the terms and conditions of an agreement between a creditor (lender) and a debtor (borrower), where the borrower is a consumer. The rules on consumer credit agreements apply to almost all credit agreements, hire-purchase agreements and consumer-hire agreements. They apply to agreements to borrow money which you make with banks, building societies, moneylenders and certain other finance companies. They do not apply to agreements to borrow money from credit unions, pawnbrokers and utility service providers or to agreements entered into by businesses. Agreements covered by the consumer credit legislation must be in writing. If they are not in writing, they are not enforceable . The legislation provides that it is an offence for a creditor to demand payment if the agreement is not enforceable. The Central Bank’s Consumer Protection Code applies to most consumer credit agreements. The Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders applies to moneylenders. Contracts In a debt context, a contract is an agreement by one party to provide goods or services for another in return for payment. In general, contracts do not have to be in writing in order to be enforceable. However, contracts for the sale of land and contracts governed by the Consumer Credit Act 1995 must be in writing in order to be enforceable. Failure to pay is a breach of the contract. Contracts may include penalty clauses for failure to meet the terms of the contract. So, for example, the contract may provide that you must pay an extra charge or you must pay interest if you fail to pay on time. Court judgment In this context, a Court judgment states that you owe a debt. That judgment can then be enforced in various ways . Credit history Your credit history is information held on the Central Credit Register or Irish Credit Bureau’s database about credit agreements and your repayment history. Your credit report is available for lenders to consult when they are considering a loan application. It is used to help lenders assess the ability of borrowers to repay any future debts. Read more in our document on your credit record . Creditor The creditor is the person (or company) to whom you owe money. This person is known as the judgment creditor if judgment is awarded against you in court. Debt forbearance and forgiveness Debt forbearance is the term that is sometimes used by creditors when they agree to allow you to change the manner in which your debt will be repaid, for example, by postponing some payments or by restructuring the manner in which repayments are made. You continue to owe all the money and you will eventually have to repay it all. Debt forgiveness or cancellation occurs when your creditor decides not to pursue the debt. Permanent debt forgiveness is rare. Some creditors may cease to pursue the debt because they recognise that you will never be able to repay it but that does not mean that the debt is forgiven or cancelled. If your circumstances change, you may still be pursued for it. Debt management firms A debt management firm is a company that charges to provide debt management services. Debt management involves: Assessing a borrower’s financial circumstances Giving advice about how to resolve a borrower’s debts Negotiating with creditors on behalf of borrowers There are a number of private commercial debt management firms, which are regulated by the Central Bank. The Central Bank has published its Authorisation Requirements and Standards for Debt Management Firms (pdf) . It has also published a Consumer Guide to debt management services (pdf) . The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) is a non-commercial body providing debt management services and it does not charge fees. Debt Relief Notice (DRN) The Debt Relief Notice is designed for people who have very low disposable income or assets. It allows for the write-off of qualifying debt up to €20,000, subject to a 3-year supervision period. Read more in our document on Debt Relief Notices . Debt Settlement Arrangement (DSA) The Debt Settlement Arrangement applies to the agreed settlement of unsecured debts, usually over a period of 5 years. (See Secured loan below for definition.) The limit of 5 years can increase to 6 years in some situations. When the DSA concludes successfully, the debts that it covers will be fully discharged and the debtor will be solvent again. Read more in our document on Debt Settlement Arrangements . Debtor You are a debtor if you owe money to someone. If a court judgment is awarded against you, you are now a judgment debtor . Debts and criminal offences Most debts arise because you have failed to meet the terms of a contract. For example, you borrow money from the bank or credit union and you fail to pay it back, or you enter into an agreement to buy equipment by instalments and you fail to pay. It is a breach of contract to fail to pay such debts - it is not generally a criminal offence. However, it is a criminal offence to fail to pay certain debts. For example, it is an offence not to pay your taxes or your TV licence fee. You may be charged and convicted for failure to pay such debts. Even if you are charged, convicted and fined, you still owe the debt and can be sued for it in the normal way. Excluded and excludable debts The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 specifies certain types of debt that cannot be written off by a Debt Relief Notice , a Debt Settlement Arrangement or a Personal Insolvency Arrangement . These are called excluded debts and are: Debts under family law orders, such as maintenance orders for spouses and     children Debts due under court awards for personal injury or death Debts arising from a loan (or forbearance of a loan) obtained through     fraud or similar wrongdoing Debts arising under court orders made under the Proceeds of Crime Acts or     fines imposed by the courts for criminal offences The types of debt that may be written off are called excludable debts and are: Taxes, duties or levies owed to the State, such as income tax, the Local     Property Tax, VAT, capital taxes Service charges owed to local authorities Rates Money owed under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (in respect of a loan     advanced by the HSE to a nursing home resident to cover the amount due from     the principal private residence) Money owed to the Department of Social Protection Debts due to owners’ management companies in respect of annual service     charges or contributions due for multi-unit developments (this is the only     non-State debt in this category) Mortgage arrears Mortgage payments that a person has not paid by the time they are due. See also ‘ Arrears ’. The Central Bank has created an infographic on mortgage arrears . Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) Under the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) (pdf) mortgage lenders must operate a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) when dealing with borrowers in mortgage arrears or in pre-arrears. The 4 steps of the MARP are: communication; financial information; assessment; and resolution. Read more in our document on the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process or the Central Bank’s Consumer guide to the CCMA . Personal insolvency The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 states that: “insolvent”, in relation to a debtor , shall be     construed as meaning that the debtor is unable to pay his or her debts in     full as they fall due The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 introduced 3 debt resolution mechanisms for people who cannot afford to pay their personal debts. These arrangements offer different solutions to people in different situations. Read more in our document on these personal insolvency options . Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) The Personal Insolvency Arrangement applies to the agreed settlement and/or restructuring of secured debts up to a total of €3 million (as well as unsecured debts) over a period of 6 years. The cap of €3 million can be increased by agreement with your secured creditors and the limit of 6 years can increase to 7 years in some situations. Read more in our document on Personal Insolvency Arrangements . Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) A Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) is a professional who is authorised by the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) and will act on your behalf throughout a Debt Settlement Arrangement or a Personal Insolvency Arrangement . Prescribed Financial Statement A Prescribed Financial Statement (PFS) is a written statement of a debtor’s financial affairs. Every applicant must complete a PFS with the help of an Approved Intermediary (for a Debt Relief Notice ) or a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (for a Debt Settlement Arrangement or a Personal Insolvency Arrangement ). The PFS is used to: See if the applicant is eligible for a debt resolution mechanism Form the basis for calculating a sustainable contribution to be paid to     the applicant’s creditors over the period of a DSA or   PIA Identify the liabilities from which the applicant will be discharged at     the end of an arrangement Priority debt The term priority debt can be used in a general sense but it can also have a specific legal meaning. If you owe money to a number of creditors , you have your own view of which of these debts take priority. Most people would regard the repayments on their home as taking priority over the repayment of other loans. The legal meaning of priority debt may be different. For example, in receiverships, liquidations and bankruptcy , the law sets out the order in which the debts must be paid. Protective certificate This is a certificate issued by a court to protect the debtor against legal proceedings by a creditor in respect of debts while a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) or a Debt Settlement Arrangement (DSA) is being put in place. The protective certificate gives you 70 days during which your creditors may not: Start or continue legal proceedings in respect of the debt Take or continue any steps to enforce a judgment or contact you about the     debt unless you agree to this Start or continue bankruptcy proceedings against you. Qualifying debt Qualifying debts are debts that can be included in a Debt Relief Notice . Examples of qualifying debts are credit cards, overdrafts, personal loans, moneylender loans and arrears on utility bills or rent payments. To apply for a Debt Relief Notice , you must have €35,000 or less of Qualifying Debts. Reasonable living expenses You are entitled to a reasonable standard of living while you address your debt problems. Reasonable living expenses is a term used by the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) to refer to the amount of money needed for you and your household to have a reasonable standard of living. This minimum standard of living allows for expenses such as food, clothing, health, education, transport, childcare and insurance. The ISI has prepared detailed guidelines on what constitutes reasonable living expenses . These guidelines are regularly updated, as required under the Act. There is also an online calculator . Repayment arrangement A repayment arrangement is a voluntary agreement between a debtor and one or more of their creditors , about how they will repay their debt. It is sometimes called an alternative repayment arrangement (ARA) or a debt repayment plan. In the case of debt, a repayment arrangement is usually voluntarily made with your creditors to repay a debt in fixed amounts over a certain time period, and depends on your abilty to pay. You should get all arrangements in writing and keep copies for your records. Let your creditors know if you cannot keep up the repayments as agreed, as you may be able to renegotiate the terms of your arrangement. Repossess This means to take back ownership of something (for example, when a mortgage provider takes over a person’s home because they have failed to pay back their mortgage on time). Read more in our document on home repossessions. Secured loan This is a loan on which property or goods are available as security against non-payment. Mortgages are the most common secured loans. Sometimes, business loans and other loans are also secured against property. In general, debts such as bank loans and credit card debt are unsecured . However, if you decide to roll up such loans into your mortgage, they now become secured loans . If the property or goods on which the security is based are subsequently sold, the secured loan must be paid off before the proceeds can be used for any other purposes. Simple contract debt This is a debt which arises because you have not paid for goods or services which are not covered by any special rules. For example, if you buy goods using a cheque and the cheque is not honoured, there is a simple contract debt to the seller. If you use the services of a plumber and do not pay him, there is a simple contract debt to the plumber. The seller or the plumber can go to court to get judgment against you and then enforce that judgment. A range of legislation provides that various fees and levies which have not been paid may be dealt with in court in the same way as simple contract debts. Sheriff Sheriffs are self-employed people who enforce debt judgments. Sheriffs can collect outstanding debts from you by seizing your property or goods. Sheriffs operate in counties Cork and Dublin. County Registrars enforce debt judgments in all other places. Sheriffs are paid for their enforcement work on a commission basis. As well as County Sheriffs in Cork and Dublin, Revenue Sheriffs enforce debts owed to the Revenue Commissioners. They have the power to collect tax debts. They can do this on the basis of a certificate of liability issued by the Collector General and do not need a court order. Revenue debts can also be collected in the normal way if there is a court order. Standard Financial Statement A Standard Financial Statement (SFS) is a written statement of financial affairs on an industry standard format (pdf) , which a borrower in mortgage difficulty must complete as part of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) . The lender must give the borrower an SFS form and must ensure that the borrower understands the MARP process. It must offer help with completing the SFS and mention sources of independent advice, such as MABS . It then uses the financial information on the form to assess the borrower’s financial position and identify the best course of action. The Central Bank has a consumer guide (pdf) to completing an SFS. Time limits/Statute of Limitations There are time limits (limitation periods) for taking most types of court action. These time limits are set either in the Statute of Limitations 1957 , as amended, or in specific legislation dealing with the court issue involved. The law in relation to time limits is complex but, in general, the time limit for taking actions for breach of contract (for example, failure to pay for goods or services provided), for debt judgments and for non-payment of charges such as rent is 6 years. If your creditor does not start the court action within 6 years of the debt being due, the action can be held to be statute-barred by the court. However, you must raise the fact that the creditor’s action is statute barred and win. If you win, this effectively means that you cannot be forced by the court to pay the debt even though the debt still exists. If your creditor gets a judgment, then, in general, they have 12 years in which to enforce that judgment . Unsecured loan This is a loan that is not attached to any asset, for example credit card debt or a personal loan. If a person does not repay their loan, the lender is not allowed take any of their assets without taking the person to court to get an enforcement order for the Sheriff . However, the lender still has a legal right to recover the debt and can do so by taking the debtor to court.",17902

You may be able to deal with the issues yourself at this stage, or you may need to see a money adviser face-to-face in a MABS office. The face-to-face service is by appointment only. When you contact MABS, it is important to tell them about anything very urgent, for example, if you are being taken to court or your electricity is to be disconnected. In cases like these, you may be able to get an emergency appointment. To be able to help you, the MABS adviser will need as much information as possible about your financial situation. You will need to collect any bills, statements, account books, payslips, or social welfare receipts that you have, as well as any letters that your creditors have sent, even if you haven’t opened them. The adviser will: Look at all your income and ensure that you are getting all your     entitlements Check through all your debts and ensure that you are the person who is     liable for them Help you to work out how much you need to cover your everyday needs Give you advice on budgeting Draw up a financial statement for use when dealing with your   creditors Help you to decide which of your debts have the highest priority Help you to work out a payment plan – how much you can afford to pay     each week off each debt Negotiate with your creditors on your behalf, if you wish Provide support while you deal with your debts Refer you to other services and contact them on your behalf, if you   wish Help to arrange to pay regular amount off your debts, as agreed with your     creditors Refer you to someone who can help with a personal     insolvency option if appropriate",2132

379,"A Debt Relief Notice (DRN) is one of 3 debt resolution arrangements for people who cannot afford to pay their personal debts. These arrangements offer different solutions to people in different situations. The Debt Relief Notice is for people who have very low disposable income or assets. It allows for the write-off of qualifying debt up to €35,000 under a 3-year supervision period. This page describes how to qualify for a DRN and how the process works. The Insolvency Service of Ireland has published information about Debt Relief Notices , including a Guide to a Debt Relief Notice (pdf) , a shorter guide to DRN (pdf) and a set of possible scenarios (pdf) . It also provides information on DRNs on its website backontrack.ie , aimed at people who are struggling with debt. You can read a general overview of personal insolvency options .",844
380,"A Debt Relief Notice deals with qualifying debts of up to €35,000 in the case of people who have very low disposable income or assets and no prospect of being able to pay off their debts in the next 3 years. The MABS Helpline provides a free service to check if you are eligible for a DRN. You can only get a DRN once. You cannot get a DRN if you are involved in one of the other personal insolvency options , or the bankruptcy process, or if you have completed such a process within the last 5 years. Qualifying debts In general, you will usually only qualify for a DRN if all of your debts are unsecured and if the total of your debt to all your creditors adds up to €35,000 or less. Unsecured debts A Debt Relief Notice mainly covers unsecured debts (though it can include some secured debts – see below) so it is important to know whether your debts are secured or not. In general, debts such as the following are unsecured: Utility bill arrears (gas, electricity etc.) Rent arrears Credit card debt Store card debt Bank overdrafts Unsecured bank loans However, if they are rolled up into your mortgage, they become secured loans. Secured debts A secured debt is a loan on which property or goods are available as security against non-payment. Mortgages and car loans are the most common secured loans. (If you have this type of debt, you cannot get a DRN but you may apply for another personal insolvency option.) Exceptions While a DRN will not cover mortgages or similar large-scale secured debt, in certain exceptional cases a loan may be secured against a small item of property, such as a ring. Such a secured debt can be included in a DRN, but only if the creditor agrees. Excluded and excludable debts The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 specifies certain types of debt that cannot be written off by a Debt Relief Notice. These are called excluded debts. The Act specifies certain other types of debt that are excludable from a DRN. This means that they can only be covered by the DRN if the creditor is asked and agrees to let them be included. If they agree, they become permitted debts – debts that the creditor permits to be covered. Most types of excludable debts are those owed to the State. The types of debts that are excluded are those that are due to: Family law orders, such as maintenance     orders for spouses and children Court awards for personal injury or death A loan (or forbearance of a loan) obtained through fraud or similar     wrongdoing Court orders made under the Proceeds of Crime Acts Fines imposed by the courts for criminal offences The types of debt that are excludable are: Taxes, duties or levies owed to the State, such as income tax, the Local     Property Tax , VAT or     capital taxes Service charges owed to local authorities Rates Money owed for a Nursing     Home Loan under the Fair Deal Scheme Money owed to the Department of Social Protection Debts due to owners’     management companies in respect of annual service charges or     contributions due for multi-unit developments (this is the only non-State     debt in this category) Income and asset tests All of your income will be taken into account, except for Child Benefit . Any assets that you have will also be valued. Income You will only qualify for a DRN if, after deducting certain outgoings, you would be left with a net monthly disposable income of €60 or less after paying reasonable living expenses. The 2 types of outgoings are: Payments in respect of debts that are outside the DRN     process – these are either excluded debts that cannot     be covered, or excludable debts that the creditor has not agreed     to include, as outlined above Reasonable living expenses , which will be assessed in     accordance with detailed guidelines – see below Your net disposable income takes account of your income from salary, wages, pensions and contributions from other household members. Any other income available to you is also taken into account – including all social welfare payments except Child Benefit. Deductions are then made for: Income tax, PRSI and other charges/levies on income (such as Universal     Social Charge ) Payments that you make in respect of excluded debts and excludable debts     (unless they are permitted debts that the creditor agrees to     include in the DRN Reasonable living expenses - see below Assets The total value of your assets must be €1,500 or less. They are assessed at market value and include savings, shares and property. The following assets are not taken into account: Essential household equipment and appliances and books, tools or     equipment needed for employment or business, up to a total value of   €6,000 Books or equipment that are reasonably necessary to enable you or a     dependant to participate in and complete a course of education (at primary     or secondary level only) A vehicle that has been adapted for a person with a disability (either     you or one of your dependants) A motor vehicle up to a value of €5,000 * One item of personal jewellery to a maximum value of €750 * Any future pension entitlement or option that you cannot choose to access     at present * A motor vehicle or piece of jewellery cannot be excluded from the asset test if the cost of buying it forms part of your qualifying debts. Reasonable standard of living and reasonable living expenses You must be left with enough income to have a reasonable standard of living for yourself and your dependants. The Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) is responsible for drawing up guidelines on what is a reasonable standard of living and reasonable living expenses . The guidelines provide examples of what may and may not be allowed as reasonable living expenses. They are reviewed every year. You can use the ISI's reasonable living expenses calculator to find out what your household's monthly expenses would be assessed at.",5883
381,"If a DRN is issued for you, it will allow for the write-off of your qualifying debt up to €35,000, subject to a 3-year supervision period. You will still have to pay any excluded debts and for any excludable debts that your creditors have not agreed to include in the DRN - see ‘Excluded and excludable debts’ above. During the supervision period, you cannot get credit of €650 or more, either on your own or as part of a joint application with someone else, without telling the lender that you have a Debt Relief Notice. You will have to tell the Insolvency Service of any change in your circumstances, for example, any increases in income, assets or liabilities. If your financial position improves above certain limits, you will have to repay part of your debts – see ‘Paying part of your debts’ below. You will also have to tell the ISI if you become aware of any errors or omissions in the documentation included in your application for the DRN. The ISI has extensive powers of investigation of anything that it considers relevant to your case. The Circuit Court may extend the supervision period in certain circumstances – see ‘Extension or unsuccessful ending of a DRN’ below. Details of your DRN will be placed on a public Register of Debt Relief Notices . Effects on your creditors The issue of the DRN will usually be the first official notification to your creditors that you have applied to have your debts written off. However, creditors with excludable debts, will be consulted beforehand about having their debts included as permitted debts. Your other creditors can object on certain specified grounds when they receive the DRN – see ‘Objections’ below. During the supervision period, your creditors will not be allowed to take any action against you for the recovery of debts covered by the DRN. This means that your creditors cannot: Start of continue legal action or Seek to recover payment for a debt or recover goods or Execute or enforce a     judgment in respect of a debt Contact you for payment However, if any of your debts were guaranteed by another person, the creditor can take action against that person. Objections Any of your creditors may apply to the Circuit Court if they object to the inclusion of the debts you owe them in the Debt Relief Notice. They can only object on the following grounds: You are not eligible for a DRN You provided inaccurate information You have failed to inform the Insolvency Service of changed circumstances     or failed to surrender extra income as required You are an undischarged bankrupt You have committed an offence under the Personal Insolvency legislation     since the DRN came into effect The procedural requirements were not followed In the 6 months before applying for the DRN, you had arranged your     financial affairs so that you could get a DRN The Court has the power to make various decisions, including extending or ending the DRN. The ISI may apply to the Court for withdrawal of the notice on similar grounds and with similar consequences – see ‘Extension or unsuccessful ending of a DRN’ below. Paying part of your debts If your income increases, or you get gifts, above a certain amount during the 3-year supervision period, you will have to give half to repay your debts. If your net income increases by €400 or more per month, you must give     half of that increase to the ISI If you get a gift or payment worth €500 or more, you must give half of     it to the ISI Your income increase is taken as whichever is the higher figure after comparing your new income to: Your income at the time of your application Your reasonable living expenses at the time of your application Income is calculated after tax, social insurance payments, levies, and payments made to any debts excluded from the DRN. Any amounts you give to the Insolvency Service will be distributed to the relevant creditors in proportion to the size of the debts that you owe to each creditor. If you pay 50% or more of the total debts covered by the Debt Relief Notice, you can exit the process before the end of the 3-year supervision period. Debt Relief Certificate At the end of the supervision period (or if you have managed to pay 50% or more of your debts) the Debt Relief Notice will cease to have effect. You will be discharged from the debts it covered and any interest or penalties on those debts. All of the information about your DRN will be removed from the public Register of Debt Relief Notices and you will be given a Debt Relief Certificate, confirming that you have been discharged from the relevant debts. The ISI will also write to all the creditors concerned, to tell them that the Debt Relief Notice has been removed from the Register. Extension or unsuccessful ending of a DRN In certain circumstances, the Debt Relief Notice may be amended or terminated, enforcement orders may be issued, or the supervision period may be extended. The main situations in which this can happen are: If you have failed to disclose an improvement in your financial position     during the supervision period, the Circuit Court can make an order for     enforcement, extend the period of the DRN, amend the DRN or make other     orders or directions. If you or one of your creditors are aggrieved by something the Insolvency     Service has done (or not done) and apply to the Circuit Court, the court     may decide to revoke a decision of the ISI or make an order as above. If it turns out that you have given incomplete or false information, were     not originally eligible for a DRN, have failed to surrender money to the     ISI or are otherwise in breach of your DRN obligations, the court can make     orders as above or can decide to terminate the DRN. In the 6 months before applying for the DRN, you had arranged your     financial affairs so that you could get a DRN If your Debt Relief Notice is terminated by the Court, you will be liable to pay all the unpaid debts that it had covered (unless the Court orders otherwise) along with any arrears, charges and interest that built up during the supervision period.",6087
382,"You must apply through an Approved Intermediary (AI) – see How to apply below. You must disclose all details of your financial affairs to the AI, who will then advise you whether or not you meet the conditions for a DRN, the consequences, and any alternative options. If you decide go ahead and apply for a DRN, you must confirm your intention in writing. Providing information You must complete a Prescribed Financial Statement (PFS), giving full and honest information about your financial circumstances. You must act in good faith and co-operate fully with the process. You must allow access to certain personal data held by banks and other financial institutions so that your financial situation can be verified. Government departments and agencies will have the power to release certain information about you. The AI will help you to complete the Prescribed Financial Statement and will then process your application if: You meet the eligibility conditions The information in your PFS is complete and accurate in all material     respects - you must confirm this by making a statutory declaration A statutory declaration is a solemn statement which must be signed in the presence of someone who is authorised to witness statutory declarations – such as a practising solicitor, a Peace Commissioner, a notary public or a Commissioner for Oaths. Fees The ISI has waived its fees for Debt Relief Notices until 31 December 2023. Next steps When the AI is satisfied that you are eligible for a Debt Relief Notice and that all the information you have provided is complete and accurate, they will sign a statement saying so. The AI will then send your application, including all the details of your financial affairs and your debts, to the Insolvency Service to have a DRN approved. When considering your application, the Insolvency Service can ask the AI for further information and can enquire into anything it considers relevant to verify the completeness and accuracy of your application. It can request information about your bank accounts, assets, liabilities, employment and income, and the law states that anyone asked for such information (your bank, employer etc.) “shall furnish the information requested as soon as practicable”. Government departments, the Revenue Commissioners and other State bodies can also provide relevant information to the ISI about your financial circumstances. The ISI will issue a certificate that your application is in order and notify the Circuit Court. The court will review the application and documentation and, if satisfied that the conditions are met, will issue a Debt Relief Notice. The Court will notify the Insolvency Service, the AI, yourself and the relevant creditor(s) of the DRN. The DRN will relate to specific debts and specific creditors. You may well have other debts that are not covered by the DRN and those creditors are not affected by it. The Insolvency Service will publish details of the DRN on the Register of Debt Relief Notices , which is accessible to the public.",3033

384,"A Debt Settlement Arrangement (DSA) is one of 3 debt resolution mechanisms for people who cannot afford to pay their personal debts. These mechanisms offer different solutions to people in different situations. The Debt Settlement Arrangement applies to the agreed settlement of unsecured debts, for example, personal loans, overdrafts, credit card or credit union loans. The arrangement usually applies over a period of 5 years. The limit of 5 years can increase to 6 years in some situations. When the DSA concludes successfully, the debts that it covers will be fully discharged and the debtor will be solvent again. This page describes how to qualify for a DSA and how the DSA process works. The Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) has published detailed information about DSAs , including possible scenarios, FAQs and a booklet. It also provides information on DSAs, including a short guide to DSAs (pdf) , on its website backontrack.ie for people who are struggling with debt. You can read a general overview of personal insolvency options here.",1051
385,"Debt Settlement Arrangements provide for the agreed settlement of debts in the case of people who have unsecured debts and have no prospect of being able to pay off their debts in the next 5 years. You may opt for a DSA if you have secured debts as well, but your secured debts will not be covered by the DSA. See ‘Secured and unsecured debts’ below for an explanation of these terms. You can only avail of a DSA once in your lifetime. You cannot get a DSA if you are involved in one of the other debt resolution processes introduced by the Act, or in the bankruptcy process. Nor can you get a DSA if you have completed a Personal Insolvency Arrangement or a bankruptcy within the last 5 years, or a Debt Relief Notice within the last 3 years. You can only get a DSA by agreement of a specified majority of your unsecured creditors – see Main elements of a DSA below. Before you make your application, you must either be domiciled in the State or, within the year, have been living in the State or had a place of business in the State. Secured and unsecured debts A Debt Settlement Arrangement only covers unsecured debts so it is important to know whether your debts are secured or not. A secured debt is a loan on which property or goods are available as security against non-payment. Mortgages and car loans are the most common secured loans. Some examples of unsecured debts are: utility bill arrears (gas, electricity etc.); credit card debt; bank overdrafts; credit union loans. However, if they are rolled up into your mortgage, they become secured loans. Qualifying debts As mentioned above, the only debts that a DSA can cover are unsecured debts. There is no limit on the total amount of debt that can be covered. However, if your total debt is unsecured and is €35,000 or less, you can opt for a Debt Relief Notice instead of a DSA. If you have some secured debts, you can apply for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement, which can cover both secured and unsecured debts. However, if you can manage to cover your secured debts, whether by making full repayments or by agreeing an arrangement with your secured creditors (such as interest-only repayments on your mortgage) you can apply for a Debt Settlement Arrangement to cover your unsecured debts separately. At least three-quarters (75%) of your unsecured debts must have built up at least 6 months before you apply for a DSA – in other words, you can’t apply for a DSA if any more than 25% of your unsecured debts were incurred in the last 6 months. Excluded debts The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 specifies certain types of debt that cannot be written off by the new debt settlement procedures, which include the Debt Settlement Arrangement. These are called excluded debts. The types of debt that are excluded and cannot be covered by a DSA are: Debts under family law orders, such as maintenance     orders for spouses and children Debts due under court awards for personal injury or wrongful death Debts arising from a loan (or forbearance of a loan) obtained through     fraud or similar wrongdoing Debts arising under fines imposed by the courts for criminal offences or     court orders made under the Proceeds of Crime Acts Excludable debts The Act specifies certain other types of debt to be excludable from a DSA. This means that they can be covered by the DSA if the creditor is asked and agrees to let them be included – in which case they become permitted debts – debts that the creditor permits to be covered. If the creditor is asked and does not respond, the creditor will also have been deemed to have consented to the debts being included. Most types of excludable debts are those owed to the State. The types of debt that are excludable and may be covered if the creditor agrees are: Taxes, duties, charges or levies owed to the State, such as income tax,     the Local     Property Tax , VAT ,     capital taxes Service charges owed to local authorities Rates Money owed under the Nursing     Homes Support Scheme (in respect of a loan advanced by the HSE to a     nursing home resident to cover the amount due from the principal private     residence) Money owed to the Department of Social Protection, such as   overpayments Debts due to owners’     management companies in respect of annual service charges or     contributions due for multi-unit developments (this is the only non-State     debt in this category)",4399
386,"You must make your proposal for a Debt Settlement Arrangement through a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) – see The DSA process below. The DSA proposal must be agreed by you and then approved at a creditors’ meeting. The proposed DSA will have to get the support of creditors representing at least 65% of the total debt that it covers. A DSA may involve you making regular payments of agreed amounts to your Personal Insolvency Practitioner, who will distribute them to your creditors according to the terms of the DSA. Your creditors may not take any action against you to enforce the debt during the lifetime of the DSA. If you keep to the terms of the DSA, the rest of your debt to the creditors that it covered will be discharged and you will be solvent again. Cross-border recognition The DSA has been designated as an insolvency proceeding which can benefit from cross-border recognition. This means that a debtor availing of a DSA will gain the same protection against creditors in most other EU countries that they receive in Ireland, subject to and in accordance with the Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings (EC) No 1346/2000 (pdf) , as updated by Regulation (EU) No.663/2014 (pdf) . Mandatory terms of a DSA There are certain elements that the DSA must contain: The maximum duration of the agreement must be 5 years but this may be     extended by up to one year in circumstances as specified in the terms of     the arrangement If you keep to the terms of the agreement your remaining debts to the     creditors covered by the DSA will be discharged You remain liable for certain debts unless the proposed arrangement     explicitly provides for a compromise agreement and the creditor has agreed     in writing to accept this – see ‘Excluded debts’ and ‘Excludable     debts’ above The DSA cannot release you from fines or other monetary penalties arising     from criminal offences It cannot require you to sell any assets that are reasonably necessary     for your employment or business unless you agree to such a sale You must be left with enough income to     maintain a reasonable standard of living for yourself and your     dependants It must not require you to dispose of your principal private residence     (your home) or to cease to occupy it unless specific conditions are met It must outline how your debts will be treated in the event of your death     or mental incapacity It must provide that your circumstances be reviewed by the Personal     Insolvency Practitioner at regular intervals (not more than 12 months)     during the currency of the DSA; this review will involve the preparation of     a new Prescribed Financial Statement that must be sent to all the   creditors. It must make provision for the Personal Insolvency Practitioner’s   costs Pension income If you are entitled to receive pension income or a pension lump sum, it will be treated as an income/asset for the purposes of a Debt Settlement Arrangement. The terms of the DSA may provide for some or all of that pension lump sum or income to be paid to your creditors while the DSA is in effect. Pension fund Your pension fund itself will be excluded from any DSA arrangement if it is a relevant pension arrangement for the purposes of the Act. Approved Retirement Funds (ARFs) are not relevant pension arrangements and may be included in a DSA. You must be transparent in relation to all pension contributions that you have made in the past. The PIP will review these and where the PIP or a creditor considers that you have made excessive pension contributions within 3 years prior to application for a protective certificate, either of them can apply to the court to recover these contributions for distribution to creditors. Credit While the DSA is in effect, you may not get credit for any amount over €650 without informing the lender that you have a DSA. You may not sell or deal in property above a certain value, except in accordance with the terms of the DSA. However, no such restriction is placed on your spouse or civil partner.",4045
387,"You must make your proposal for a DSA through a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP). This is a professional who is authorised by the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) and will act on your behalf throughout the Debt Settlement Arrangement. The ISI has developed a standard protocol for use by PIPs when making straightforward proposals to creditors for a DSA. You must disclose all details of your financial affairs to the PIP, who will then advise you whether or not you meet the conditions for a DSA, what the consequences will be and what fees you may have to pay. The PIP will also advise you of any other options that are available. The PIP will help you complete a Prescribed Financial Statement as part of your application, giving full and honest information about your financial circumstances. You must also make a declaration that you have been unable to agree an alternative repayment arrangement with your creditor(s). You will have to give your written consent to enable: The PIP to disclose your personal data to the ISI The ISI to process your application The ISI to make any necessary enquiries about you and The ISI to disclose your personal data to the creditors concerned, as     required In general, you must act in good faith and co-operate fully with the process. Fees The ISI has waived its fees for the 3 debt solutions until 31 December 2023. There is no set scale of fees for PIPs, but they are required to specify their charges and associated costs clearly before being appointed to act on your behalf. Protective certificate The Personal Insolvency Practitioner sends your application to the Insolvency Service. The ISI checks that all the details are in order and, if so, issues a certificate to that effect and forwards all the documentation to the relevant court (the Circuit Court in cases up to €2.5 million and the High Court in larger cases). The court reviews the documentation and, if all is in order, issues a protective certificate. The Insolvency Service records the details of the protective certificate on its Register of Protective Certificates . The Personal Insolvency Practitioner then notifies each of your creditors of the existence of the protective certificate and your intention to make a proposal for a DSA. The protective certificate will give you an initial period of 70 days during which your creditors may not: Start or continue legal proceedings in respect of the debt Take or continue any steps to enforce a judgment or contact you about the     debt unless you agree to this Start or continue bankruptcy proceedings against you The court may extend the period of the protective certificate by up to 40 days if it is satisfied that: You and the Personal Insolvency Practitioner have acted in good faith and     with reasonable expedition, and It is likely that, if the extension is granted, a proposal for a DSA will     be made that is likely to be accepted by the creditors and successfully     completed by you The court may also extend the period of the protective certificate by up to 40 days, or by a further period up to 40 days, where there are exceptional circumstances or other circumstances outside your or the PIP’s control. A creditor may apply to the court for an order directing that the protective certificate not apply to him or her. The court will grant this order only if satisfied that failing to give it would cause irreparable loss to the creditor that would not otherwise occur and that no other creditor to whom notice of the protective certificate has been given would be unfairly prejudiced. Formulating a DSA proposal Once the protective certificate has been granted, your PIP must invite the relevant creditors to make proposals about the manner in which the debts might be dealt with as part of a DSA. The creditors must be given your Prescribed Financial Statement. In order to help the PIP to formulate the proposal, you will be required to provide an honest and accurate account of your living expenses, your life plans and any circumstances that may be relevant to how much of your debts you can pay, now and in the future. When formulating the proposal for a DSA, the PIP will ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that you are not required to sell or move out of your principal private residence (your home). If you wish to move out, or if the PIP believes that the running costs of staying in your home are disproportionately large, the DSA may provide for you to move out of it. Creditors’ meeting When you have consented to the proposal for a DSA that has been formulated by your PIP, the PIP must call a creditors’ meeting. If there is only one creditor, he or she may write to the PIP indicating agreement or rejection. The creditors vote on whether or not to accept the proposed arrangement. Each vote is proportional to the amount of debt owed to that creditor. In order for the arrangement to be accepted, creditors representing 65% or more of the value of your total unsecured debt must vote in favour of the proposal. If the creditors reject the proposal, the protective certificate ceases to have effect and the DSA process will have come to an end. If the proposal is accepted, the PIP must inform the Insolvency Service and tell creditors of their right to object to the relevant court - (the Circuit Court in cases up to €2.5 million and the High Court in larger cases). The Insolvency Service notifies the court. If there is any objection, the protective certificate remains in place until the matter is decided. Objections by creditors The grounds on which an objection to the coming into effect of the Debt Settlement Arrangement may be made are limited and include the following: You arranged your affairs in the previous 2 years primarily with a view     to becoming eligible for a Debt Settlement Arrangement or a Personal     Insolvency Arrangement The procedural requirements were not followed A material inaccuracy or omission exists in your Prescribed Financial     Statement that causes a material detriment to the creditor You did not meet the requirements when the arrangement was proposed The arrangement unfairly prejudices the interests of a creditor You have committed an offence under the personal insolvency   legislation You have entered into a transaction at an undervalue or given a     preference to a person in the previous three years that has materially     contributed to your inability to pay your debts Issuing a Debt Settlement Arrangement If there is no objection or an objection is not upheld, the court approves the Debt Settlement Arrangement if satisfied that all the conditions have been met. The Insolvency Service records the DSA in its Register of Debt Settlement Arrangements and it comes into effect. Deferring Local Property Tax Once you have entered into a Debt Settlement Arrangement, you can apply for a deferral of Local Property Tax (LPT) while the DSA is in place. Read more on revenue.ie . Varying or ending a Debt Settlement Arrangement Debt Settlement Arrangements may be varied if there is a material change in a debtor’s circumstances that would affect his/her ability to make repayments under the DSA – the procedures are similar to those for setting up the arrangement. A creditor or a PIP may apply to the court at any time during the Debt Settlement Arrangement to have it ended . The grounds for such an application will be limited and include the following: Your Prescribed Financial Statement has a material inaccuracy or omission     that causes a material detriment to the creditor You did not meet the eligibility criteria when you started the   process You did not comply with the terms of the Debt Settlement Arrangement You have committed an offence under the personal insolvency legislation     since the arrangement came into effect You are in arrears with your payments for a period of not less than 3     months The full list of grounds is in Section 83 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 . If you are in arrears with your payments for more than 6 months, the DSA will be deemed to have failed. This will be recorded in the Register of Debt Settlement Arrangements. When a Debt Settlement Arrangement ends If the arrangement ends other than by successful completion, you become fully liable for all specified debts, including arrears, charges and interest that have accrued during the DSA period, less any payments made by you during that time, unless the terms of the DSA specify, or the court has ordered, otherwise. If the arrangement is successfully completed, you are discharged from the debts covered by the DSA. The successful completion is recorded on the Register of Debt Settlement Arrangements. You are now solvent.",8714

389,"A Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) is one of 3 debt resolution mechanisms introduced by the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 for people who cannot afford to pay their personal debts. These mechanisms offer different solutions to people in different situations. The Personal Insolvency Arrangement applies to the agreed settlement and/or restructuring of secured debts up to a total of €3 million (as well as unsecured debts) over a period of up to 6 years. The cap of €3 million can be increased by agreement with your secured creditors and the limit of 6 years can increase to 7 years in some situations. This page describes how to qualify for a PIA and how the PIA process works. The Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) has published detailed information about PIAs , including possible scenarios, FAQs and a guidebook. It also provides information on PIAs, including a short guide to PIAs (pdf) , on its website backontrack.ie , for people who are struggling with debt. You can read a general overview of personal insolvency options here. Provision for court review Where a mortgage lender rejects the borrower’s proposal for a PIA, an application can be made for a court review of that rejection. Since 25 June 2021, all mortgages in arrears or the subject to an alternative payment arrangement can seek a court review of the rejection. Before 25 June 2021, this review option only applied to mortgages that were in arrears on 1 January 2015, or to mortgages that were in arrears before that and where the borrower entered into an alternative repayment arrangement . As part of Abhaile, the national Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service , an aid and advice scheme for people in serious mortgage arrears covers free legal representation for eligible borrowers in seeking such a court review. The court will review the application, including any objections made by creditors. Subject to meeting certain criteria set out in the legislation, the judge may impose the original PIA proposal on the creditor(s).",2008
390,"Personal Insolvency Arrangements provide for the agreed settlement and/or restructuring of debts in the case of people who have secured debts up to a total of €3 million (as well as any unsecured debts) and have no prospect of being able to pay off their debts in the next 5 years. You can only avail of a PIA once in your lifetime. You cannot get a PIA if you are involved in one of the other debt resolution processes introduced by the Act, or in the bankruptcy process, or if you have completed one of these processes within the last 5 years (3 years for a Debt Relief Notice). Under the original legislation, you could only get a PIA by agreement of a specified majority of your secured and unsecured creditors – see Main elements of a PIA below. However, as noted above, you can now seek a court review if a mortgage lender rejects your personal insolvency proposal. See ‘Creditors’ meeting’ below for more detail. You must be domiciled in the State, or else have been living or had a place of business in the State within the year before you make your application. Qualifying debts You will only qualify for a PIA if you owe debt to at least one secured creditor holding security over Irish property or assets (secured debt). If you have no secured debts you should apply for a Debt Settlement Arrangement or a Debt Relief Notice . In general, the total of your debt to your secured creditors must add up to less than €3 million. However, this cap can be waived if all of your secured creditors agree in writing. At least three-quarters (75%) of your debts must have built up at least 6 months before you apply for a PIA – in other words, you can’t apply for a PIA if any more than 25% of your debts were incurred in the last 6 months. Secured and unsecured debts A Personal Insolvency Arrangement is only for people who have secured debts (though it can include unsecured debts – see below) so it is important to know whether your debts are secured or not. A secured debt is a loan on which property or goods are available as security against non-payment. Mortgages and car loans are the most common secured loans. Some examples of unsecured debts are: utility bill arrears (gas, electricity etc.); credit card debt; bank overdrafts; credit union loans. However, if they are rolled up into your mortgage, they become secured loans. Excluded and excludable debts The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 specifies certain types of debt that cannot be written off by the debt settlement procedures that it introduced, which include the Personal Insolvency Arrangement. These are called excluded debts. The Act specifies certain other types of debt to be excludable from a PIA. This means that they can be covered by the PIA if the creditor is asked and agrees to let them be included – in which case they become permitted debts – debts that the creditor permits to be covered. If the creditor is asked and does not respond, the creditor is also deemed to have consented to the debts being included. Most types of excludable debts are those owed to the State. The types of debt that are excluded and cannot be covered by a PIA are: Debts under family law orders, such as maintenance     orders for spouses and children Debts due under court awards for personal injury or death Debts arising from a loan (or forbearance of a loan) obtained through     fraud or similar wrongdoing Debts arising under court orders made under the Proceeds of Crime Acts or     fines imposed by the courts for criminal offences The types of debt that are excludable and may be covered if the creditor agrees are: Taxes, duties, charges or levies owed to the State, such as income tax,     the Local     Property Tax , VAT , capital     taxes Service charges owed to local authorities Rates Money owed under the Nursing     Homes Support Scheme (in respect of a loan advanced by the HSE to a     nursing home resident to cover the amount due from the principal private     residence) Money owed to the Department of Social Protection, such as   overpayments Debts due to owners’ management     companies in respect of annual service charges or contributions due for     multi-unit developments (this is the only non-State debt in this   category) Mortgage arrears on your home In general, you must declare that you have co-operated with your mortgage lender for at least 6 months in respect of your principal private residence (your home) in accordance with the Central Bank’s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears ; and that, in spite of this co-operation, you have been unable to agree an alternative repayment arrangement or the lender has confirmed in writing that it does not wish to enter into such an arrangement. This rule does not apply if your Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) – see below – declares that you would still not be likely to be solvent in 5 years if you accepted such an alternative repayment arrangement. If you are facing mortgage arrears, see our section on mortgage arrears for more information.",5000
391,"You must make your proposal for a PIA through a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) – see The PIA process below. Once you have agreed the terms of the PIA proposal with your PIP, you then need approval from a creditors’ meeting or, failing that, your proposal may be imposed on your creditors after a court review. See ‘Creditors’ meeting’ below’ for more detail. A PIA may involve you making regular payments of agreed amounts to your Personal Insolvency Practitioner, who then distributes them to your creditors according to the terms of the PIA. Your creditors may not take any action against you to enforce the debt during the lifetime of the PIA. If you keep to the terms of the PIA, the rest of your debt to your unsecured creditors will be discharged. However, when the PIA ends, you will still be liable for the outstanding amount of your secured debts, such as your mortgage. Cross-border recognition The PIA has been designated as an insolvency proceeding which can benefit from cross-border recognition. This means that a debtor availing of a PIA will gain the same protection against creditors in most other EU countries that they receive in Ireland, subject to and in accordance with the Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings (EC) No 1346/2000 (pdf) , as updated by Regulation (EU) No.663/2014 (pdf) . Mandatory terms of a PIA There are certain elements that the PIA must contain: The maximum duration of the agreement must be 6 years but this may be     extended by up to 1 year in circumstances as specified in the terms of the     arrangement The PIA must clearly distinguish between secured debts and unsecured     debts and must make provision for the manner in which the security held by     the creditor is to be treated. Unless your secured creditors agree     otherwise, they may get the full value of their security or the full amount     of the debt if the property is sold. If they agree to accept less than the     full value of the security, there is a clawback if the security is sold for     greater than the value estimated at the time of the arrangement. If you keep to the terms of the agreement your remaining debts to your     unsecured creditors will be discharged You remain liable for certain debts unless the proposed arrangement     explicitly provides for a compromise agreement and the creditor has agreed     in writing to accept this – see ‘Excluded and excludable debts’   above The PIA cannot release you from fines or other monetary penalties arising     from criminal offences It cannot require you to sell any assets that are reasonably necessary     for your employment or business unless you agree to such a sale You must be left with enough income to     maintain a reasonable standard of living for yourself and your     dependants It must not require you to dispose of your principal private residence     (your home) or to cease to occupy it unless specific conditions are met –     see ‘Secured creditors’ below It must outline how your debts will be treated in the event of your death     or mental incapacity It must provide that your circumstances be reviewed by the Personal     Insolvency Practitioner at regular intervals (not more than 12 months)     during the currency of the PIA; this review will involve the preparation of     a new Prescribed Financial Statement that must be sent to all the   creditors. It must make provision for the Personal Insolvency Practitioner’s   costs Pension income Ongoing pension income receivable by you or an entitlement to a pension lump sum or income in accordance with the tax code will be treated as an asset or, as applicable, income for the purposes of a PIA. The terms of the PIA may provide for payment of some or all of that pension/lump sum or income to creditors during the PIA period. Pension fund Your pension fund will be excluded from any PIA if it is a relevant pension arrangement for the purposes of the Act. Approved Retirement Funds (ARFs) do not fall into this category and may be included in a PIA. There will be an onus on you to be transparent in relation to all historical pension contributions and the PIP will review these. If a creditor or your PIP considers that you have made excessive pension contributions in the 3 years before applying for a PIA, an application can be made to the court to recover these contributions for distribution to your creditors. Credit While the PIA is in effect, you may not get credit for any amount over €650 without informing the lender that you have a PIA. You may not sell or deal in property above a certain value, except in accordance with the terms of the PIA. However, no such restriction is placed on your spouse or civil partner.",4700
392,"You must make your proposal for a PIA through a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP). This is a professional who is authorised by the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) and will act on your behalf throughout the Personal Insolvency Arrangement. The ISI has developed standard protocols for use by PIPs when making straightforward proposals to creditors for a PIA or a Debt Settlement Arrangement. You must disclose all details of your financial affairs to the PIP, who will then advise you whether or not you meet the conditions for a PIA, the consequences, any alternative options, and the fees that you may have to pay. You must act in good faith and co-operate fully with the process. The PIP will help you complete a Prescribed Financial Statement as part of your application, giving full and honest information about your financial circumstances. You must also make a declaration that you have been unable to agree an alternative repayment arrangement with your creditor(s) or that your creditor(s) have confirmed in writing that they are unwilling to enter into an alternative repayment arrangement in respect of your principal private residence. See ‘Mortgage arrears on your home’ above for specific rules about mortgage debt. You will have to give your written consent to enable: The PIP to disclose your personal data to the ISI The ISI to process your application The ISI to make any necessary enquiries about you and The ISI to disclose your personal data to the creditors concerned, as     required In general, you must act in good faith and co-operate fully with the process. Fees The ISI has waived its fees for the 3 debt solutions until 31 December 2023. There is no set scale of fees for PIPs, but they are required to specify their charges and associated costs clearly before being appointed to act on your behalf. Protective certificate The Personal Insolvency Practitioner sends your application to the ISI. The ISI checks that all the details are in order and, if so, issues a certificate to that effect and forwards all to the relevant court (the Circuit Court in cases up to €2.5 million and the High Court in larger cases). The court reviews the documentation and, if all is in order, issues a protective certificate. The ISI records the details of the protective certificate on its Register of Protective Certificates . The PIP then notifies each of your creditors of the existence of the protective certificate and your intention to make a proposal for a PIA. The protective certificate will give you an initial period of 70 days during which your creditors may not: Start or continue legal proceedings in respect of the debt Take or continue any steps to enforce a judgment or contact you about the     debt unless you agree to this Start or continue bankruptcy proceedings against you The court may extend the period of the protective certificate by up to 40 days if it is satisfied that: You and the PIP have acted in good faith and with reasonable expedition,     and It is likely that, if the extension is granted, a proposal for a PIA will     be made that is likely to be accepted by the creditors and successfully     completed by you The court may also extend the period of the protective certificate by up to 40 days, or by a further period up to 40 days, where there are exceptional circumstances or other circumstances outside your or the PIP’s control. A creditor may apply to the court for an order directing that the protective certificate not apply to him or her. The court will grant this order only if satisfied that failing to give it would cause irreparable loss to the creditor that would not otherwise occur and that no other creditor to whom notice of the protective certificate has been given would be unfairly prejudiced. Contacting your creditors Once the protective certificate has been granted, your PIP must invite the relevant creditors to make proposals about the manner in which the debts might be dealt with as part of a PIA. The creditors must be given your Prescribed Financial Statement. Secured creditors The PIA must provide for the way in which security held by your creditors is treated. Unless they agree otherwise, they may get the full value of their security or the full amount that you owe them if the security (such as a second property) is sold. When formulating the proposal for a PIA, the PIP will ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that you are not required to sell or move out of your principal private residence (your home). If you wish to move out, or if the PIP believes that the running costs of staying in your home are disproportionately large, the PIA may provide for you to move out of it. Creditors’ meeting When you have consented to the proposal for a PIA that has been formulated by your PIP, the PIP must call a creditors’ meeting. If there is only one creditor, he or she may write to the PIP indicating agreement or rejection. The creditors vote on whether or not to accept the proposed arrangement. Each vote is proportional to the amount of debt owed to that creditor. Creditors representing 65% or more of the value of the total debt – both secured and unsecured – must vote in favour, for the arrangement to be accepted. In addition, over 50% of your secured creditors and 50% of unsecured creditors must vote in favour. The Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015 provides for court review where a mortgage lender rejects the borrower’s personal insolvency proposal. Read more detail about this process in the ISI’s press release (pdf) . The Abhaile aid and advice scheme for people in serious mortgage arrears covers free legal representation for eligible borrowers in seeking such a court review. If the proposal is accepted, the PIP must inform the Insolvency Service and tell creditors of their right to object to the relevant court - (the Circuit Court in cases up to €2.5 million and the High Court in larger cases). The Insolvency Service notifies the court. If there is any objection, the protective certificate remains in place until the matter is decided. Objections by creditors The grounds on which an objection to the coming into effect of the Personal Insolvency Arrangement may be made are limited and include the following: You arranged your affairs in the previous 2 years primarily with a view     to becoming eligible for a Debt Settlement Arrangement or a Personal     Insolvency Arrangement The procedural requirements were not followed A material inaccuracy or omission exists in your Prescribed Financial     Statement that causes a material detriment to the creditor You did not meet the requirements when the arrangement was proposed The arrangement unfairly prejudices the interests of a creditor You have committed an offence under the Personal Insolvency   legislation You have entered into a transaction at an undervalue or given a     preference to a person in the previous three years that has materially     contributed to your inability to pay your debts Issue of a Personal Insolvency Arrangement If there is no objection or an objection is not upheld, the court approves the Personal Insolvency Arrangement if satisfied that all the conditions have been met. The Insolvency Service records the PIA in its Register of Personal Insolvency Arrangements and it comes into effect. Deferring Local Property Tax Once you have entered into a Personal Insolvency Arrangement, you can apply for a deferral of Local Property Tax (LPT) while the PIA is in place. Read more on revenue.ie . Varying a Personal Insolvency Arrangement Personal Insolvency Arrangements may be varied – the procedures are similar to those for setting up the arrangement. A creditor or a PIP may apply to the court at any time during the Personal Insolvency Arrangement to have it ended. The grounds for such an application are limited and include the following: Your Prescribed Financial Statement has a material inaccuracy or omission     that causes a material detriment to the creditor You did not meet the requirements when you started the process You did not comply with the terms of the Personal Insolvency   Arrangement You have committed an offence under the personal insolvency legislation     since the arrangement came into effect You are in arrears with your payments for a period of not less than 3     months The full list of grounds is in Section 122 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 . If you are in arrears with your payments for more than 6 months, the PIA will be deemed to have failed. This will be recorded in the Register of Personal Insolvency Arrangements. Ending of a Personal Insolvency Arrangement If the arrangement ends other than by successful completion, you will become fully liable for all specified debts, inclusive of arrears, charges and interest that have accrued during the PIA period, less any payments made by you during that time, unless the terms of the PIA specify, or the court has ordered, otherwise. If the arrangement is successfully completed, you are discharged from the unsecured debts covered by the arrangement. You will not be discharged from the secured debts, except where this was explicitly provided for in the PIA. The successful completion is recorded on the Register of Personal Insolvency Arrangements.",9277

394,"There are 3 debt resolution procedures to help mortgage-holders and other people with unsustainable debt to reach agreements with their creditors. These procedures offer different solutions to people in different situations. Each option has its own rules and procedures. One important issue is whether your debts are secured or not. Secured debt means debt backed by an asset, for example, a mortgage. Unsecured debt includes debts on credit cards, loans and overdrafts. The 3 debt resolution procedures are: A Debt Relief Notice (DRN) to allow for the write-off of debt (generally     unsecured and in some cases secured) up to €35,000, with a 3-year     supervision period A Debt Settlement Arrangement (DSA) for the agreed settlement of     unsecured debt, with no limit involved, normally over a period of 5   years A Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) for the agreed settlement of     secured debt up to €3 million (though this cap can be increased) and     unsecured debt, with no limit involved, normally over a period of up to 6     years These procedures were introduced by the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 and are described in more detail below. If you have tried to solve your debt problems with these procedures but they are not suitable you can apply for bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is a formal High Court process for people with debt over €20,000.",1359
395,"Each of the 3 debt resolution procedures has its own rules and procedures but the following main rules apply to all of them. Limits on usage You can be involved in only one of the 3 procedures (DRN, DSA or PIA) or in the bankruptcy process at any one time. If you use one of these 4 processes, you will generally have to wait some years before applying to use another. You may use each of the 3 procedures only once in your lifetime. (There is no such limit on bankruptcy but it would be rare for anyone to go bankrupt twice.) Running up debts You must not deliberately stop paying (or underpay) your creditors while these procedures are being set up as this may cause your application to be ineligible. Provision of information You will have to complete a Prescribed Financial Statement, giving full and honest information about your financial circumstances. The required information for the statement is set out in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 (Prescribed Financial Statement) Regulations 2014 . You must sign a declaration that you are acting in good faith and co-operate fully with the process. You will have to give your written consent that certain personal data held by banks and other financial institutions can be accessed so that your financial situation can be verified. Government departments and agencies will have the power to release certain information about you. Public registers If you use any of these 3 procedures, your name and details will be published on a register, which is available to the public on the ISI website . The success or failure of the process will also be recorded.",1608
396,"The Debt Relief Notice (DRN) process provides debt relief for people who have virtually no disposable income or assets and no prospect of being able to pay off the debt in the next 3 years. If a DRN is issued for you, it will allow for the write-off of your qualifying debt up to €35,000 subject to a 3-year supervision period. During this period your creditors will not be able to pursue you for payment, but if your circumstances improve during the 3 years, you may have to pay part of your debts accordingly. At the end of the 3 years, all of the debts covered by the DRN will be written off, even if you have not managed to pay anything off them. How do you get a DRN? Your application must be made through an Approved Intermediary (AI) – see How to apply below. This is someone who is authorised by the ISI to assist you with your application.

397,"A Debt Settlement Arrangement (DSA) provides for the agreed settlement of unsecured debt with one or more creditors over a period of 5 years, with a possible agreed extension to 6 years. You may apply for a DSA if the levels of your income, assets and debts mean that you are not eligible for a Debt Relief Notice. You must be able to make some repayments to your creditors in return for a discount of your debts. The DSA is a voluntary arrangement and it will have to get the support of creditors representing at least 65% of your total debt. You must apply through a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP). This is a professional who is approved and registered by the Insolvency Service of Ireland to operate DSAs and Personal Insolvency Arrangements – see How to apply below.

402,"If you have debts over €20,000 and you are not able to repay them, bankruptcy may provide a way to settle your debts if the other personal insolvency options are not appropriate for your circumstances. Bankruptcy distributes your assets among the creditors you owe money to and protects you from these creditors. The distribution is done through a court official, the Official Assignee in Bankruptcy, who is based in the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) and manages its Bankruptcy Division. Usually, after one year you will be discharged from bankruptcy and all of your debts will be written off. Bankruptcy deals with both secured and unsecured debt. A secured debt is a loan on which property or goods are available as security against non-payment. Mortgages and car loans are the most common secured loans. Other debts are called unsecured debts, for example, utility bill arrears, credit card debt and bank overdrafts. However, if they are rolled up into your mortgage, they become secured loans.",1003

If none of these are suitable, you may decide that declaring bankruptcy is the best solution for you. The ISI has published detailed information on bankruptcy , including a short guide to bankruptcy (pdf) a detailed Debtor’s Guide to Bankruptcy (pdf) and a set of Bankruptcy Scenarios (pdf) . Its backontrack.ie website also has user-friendly information and guides on bankruptcy . In some circumstances, the High Court can make you bankrupt at the request of a creditor. This request is made in a document called a petition. A creditor can petition for bankruptcy against you if you have committed an act of bankruptcy within the previous 3 months. This is known as a creditor’s petition . Examples of acts of bankruptcy are: If you are served with a bankruptcy summons requesting payment of a     specific sum and you fail to comply within 14 days If the sheriff or county registrar makes a return of 'no goods' when they     are authorised to seize your belongings but find no goods to seize The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 introduced two additional acts of bankruptcy: Where the debtor has been subject to a Debt Settlement Arrangement which has been terminated or which is deemed to have failed Where the debtor has been subject to a Personal Insolvency     Arrangement which has been terminated or which has failed The ISI has published information for creditors .",1553

The process is summarised below: Pay a fee of €200 to the Official Assignee and email proof of the     lodgement to the ISI Bankruptcy Division Complete your petition, which must be verified by a sworn affidavit and a     sworn statement of affairs File the relevant bankruptcy application documents in the Examiner’s     Office Attend the court hearing on the date given, where the judge will     adjudicate you bankrupt if you meet the requirements Meet the Official Assignee or Bankruptcy Inspector to be interviewed     about your assets and debts Place a notice of your adjudication as a bankrupt in Iris Oifigiúil (the State gazette)     and on the ISI's website",1146
405,"A Bankruptcy Inspector from the ISI will serve you with a copy of the Order of Adjudication (Bankruptcy Order) and Warrant of Seizure. The Inspector will also give you a Statement of Personal Information Form to complete, requesting various details, which the ISI will use to contact you and process your bankruptcy. Your bank accounts will be frozen, except for one current account in which you can keep a balance of up to €1,000 for general living expenses. The ISI will contact all financial institutions and inform them that you have been made bankrupt. As soon as your bankruptcy starts, you are free of debt. The Official Assignee now owns your assets and administers your estate. Your creditors can no longer seek repayment directly from you. They must deal directly with the Official Assignee and all correspondence should be forwarded to him. You must contribute any surplus income to the Official Assignee. Your name will appear in the Bankruptcy Register, which is kept in the Office of the Examiner of the High Court . Anyone can check this register. Read more in the ISI guide After you are made bankrupt (pdf) . Income The Official Assignee will negotiate an Income Payment Agreement or seek an Income Payment Order for the surplus of your income over the reasonable living expenses for your situation, based on the ISI’s guidelines . The agreement or order will last up to 3 years. No deductions will be made from social welfare payments. Assets All of your assets, with the exception of necessities up to a value of €6,000, are transferred to the Official Assignee, who will sell them. You can keep essential assets up to a value of €6,000, but you can apply to the court to increase that figure. The assets may include: Clothes Vehicles Furniture and tools or equipment relating to trade Necessities for your family and any dependent relatives living with   you Once your assets are sold, the Official Assignee will pay costs, expenses, fees and certain priority debts, such as taxes, and distribute the remainder among your creditors. If you acquire assets after the date when you are made bankrupt (for example, through inheritance) the Official Assignee can claim them and sell them for the benefit of your creditors. If you own a family home, by yourself or with another person, the Official Assignee may only sell it with the prior permission of the court. Where this permission is sought, the court will balance the interests of your creditors against the interests of your family and may decide to postpone the sale of your home. If you hold property jointly (for example, with your spouse) your bankruptcy will cause the joint ownership to be split between the Official Assignee and your non-bankrupt co-owner. If the Official Assignee has not sold your home within 3 years, ownership may automatically transfer back to you, unless otherwise agreed. Restrictions on people who have been declared bankrupt Once you have been declared bankrupt, you will be guilty of an offence if: You do not disclose the bankruptcy when getting a loan or any other     credit facility of €650 or more You do not disclose the bankruptcy if you trade under a different name to     when you were made bankrupt You act as a director, manager, auditor, liquidator or receiver of a     company without permission of the court Other restrictions include that: You cannot be granted an enduring power of     attorney on behalf of someone else, and if you hold one already, it is     automatically revoked if you become bankrupt. Under the Charities     Act 2009 , you may not be a trustee of a charity if you are adjudicated     bankrupt. Some professional bodies disqualify members who are adjudicated bankrupt. If you wish to travel outside the State, you should tell the Official     Assignee. You may be arrested if it seems to the High Court that you are     leaving the State in order to avoid the consequences of your   bankruptcy. Cross-border recognition The EU Insolvency Regulation aims to simplify formalities governing the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in cross-border insolvency matters. The Regulation designates bankruptcy as an insolvency proceeding which can benefit from cross-border recognition. This means that a debtor availing of bankruptcy will gain the same protection against creditors in most other EU countries that they receive in Ireland, subject to the Regulation.",4417

Prosecution If you do not pay your tax on time, you may be prosecuted and convicted of an offence. This may lead to a fine or imprisonment (or both). The level of fine and length of imprisonment vary according to the seriousness of the different offences. Regardless of the outcome of the prosecution, you must still repay the underpayment. The main ways in which Revenue collects overdue taxes from individuals are: Phased payment arrangements Collection by Sheriff Court action Attachment of a debt Phased payment arrangements If you owe money to Revenue for unpaid taxes, you may be able to agree a repayment arrangement. In general, interest applies to any late taxes and so you have to pay this as well. In some cases, you may also have to pay penalties. If you are paying income tax through Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and you underpay in a particular year, you may be able to pay the amount due by having your tax credits in a following year reduced. In general, interest is not applied to these repayments. In other cases where you have not paid or have underpaid your tax, you may be able to agree a phased payment arrangement. In general, you will have to pay interest as well as the amount owed. Collection by Sheriff If you get a final demand for the payment of any taxes due and you do not respond, Revenue can take action. It can refer your case to the Sheriff for to enforce the debt. It is not necessary to have a court order. The Sheriff is given a warrant, which is legal authority to enforce collection of Revenue debts, if necessary, by seizing goods. A warrant is valid for 12 months. However, if the Sheriff does not collect any of the debt within 6 months, the certificate must be returned to Revenue. The Sheriff has the authority to negotiate a payment arrangement, with you. The repayment arrangement must be for 2 years or less. Once your case has gone to the Sheriff, you must then deal with the Sheriff. You are no longer able to deal with Revenue officials. Revenue Sheriffs are officers of the courts and are responsible to the courts. There is a Code of Practice for Revenue Sheriffs (pdf) . Court action Revenue has contracts with several firms of solicitors to help enforce Revenue debts. They are involved in taking cases through the courts . If the court grants a judgment order, it is enforced in the normal way. Attachment of a debt Revenue has specific powers of attachment of debt, which can be used without a court order. Read more about how this works . Local Property Tax If you are a liable person for Local Property Tax (LPT) and you do not make a return, Revenue’s estimate will become payable by default. A liable person means the person responsible for paying. Revenue will then collect the amount due in the normal ways, such as deduction at source or attachment order. If Revenue cannot collect the amount of LPT due, then a charge will be put on your property. You will not be able to sell your property without paying the accumulated tax together with interest and, penalties (if applicable). Read more about the Local Property Tax .

The arrears were converted into LPT, to be collected through the LPT system and pursued by Revenue. Interest and penalties under the LPT system will apply to the additional €200. Non-principal private residence (second home) charge If you owned a second residence in any year between 2009 and 2013 inclusive, you had to pay the Non-Principal Private Residence (NPPR) charge. Late payment fees and penalties applied if you did not pay the charge by the liability date each year. If you were liable for the full period and did not pay (or agree terms) by 31 August 2014, you now owe a total of €7,230 on the property.

When you decide which type is best for your needs, you can save money by shopping around different providers.

Get a loan to suit your needs There are many different types of loans or credit. Each type of credit is suitable for a different purpose. Some are more suited to short-term borrowing and others are more suited to borrowing for longer. See ‘Types of credit’ below. Shop around for the best value When looking for a loan, it is worth shopping around for the best value. To compare charges, interest on loans must be shown as the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) . The APR shows what percentage of the amount you borrow will be charged in addition to paying back the amount borrowed. It is important to compare like with like. Loans can be paid back over different terms or lengths of time. You may think that you are getting a good deal on a loan with a low APR but if you are paying more instalments over a longer period of time you may find that it will cost you more. If you are comparing loans that are for different lengths of time, you should instead compare the cost of credit. The cost of credit looks at the total cost of the loan. It is the difference between the amount you borrow and the total you repay.

Firms providing these services must be authorised by the Central Bank . Hire purchase can also be arranged through a retailer. If you take out a HP agreement with a retailer, you should know that the store or garage is not actually providing the loan. It is acting as an agent for a finance company and will earn commission from the finance company for arranging the loan. This is called being a credit intermediary and the agent must be authorised by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) to do this. You can check if the agent is authorised by using the Register of Credit Intermediaries . Hire purchase agreements usually last between 2 and 5 years. Most HP agreements last 3 years.

461,"To calculate the real cost of a hire purchase agreement: Find the total hire purchase price Find the price of a cash purchase of the same item Deduct the cash price (2) from the total hire purchase price (1) Example : A garage offers two prices for the same car. The car will cost you €12,000 if you buy it outright with cash. Alternatively, the car will cost you €17,000 if you want to hire purchase the car: €17,000 €12,000 €17,000 - €12,000 = €5,000 In this example, the hire purchase cost is €5,000. That is, it will cost you €5,000 extra to hire the car for a period of time (and eventually to own it), rather than to buy it outright for cash. Different lenders have different hire purchase costs. Some will quote an APR (Annual Percentage Rate). This can help you to compare hire purchase costs. It may be misleading to compare a hire purchase APR with that of a normal bank or credit union loan. This is because you are paying for the hire of the goods. Unlike a loan, you do not own them until the last instalment of the HP agreement has been paid. There is a maximum interest rate of 23% APR for hire purchase agreements since 16 May 2022. If you would like independent information or help understanding the terms and conditions of a HP agreement (or any other loan), you can contact the CCPC . If you are struggling with a HP debt, you can contact MABS for free and independent advice.",1395
462,"Hire purchase agreements may also involve additional fees and charges. These fees and charges vary, but may include: Documentation fees Penalty fees for missed or late payments Interest surcharge for missed repayments - this means an additional     amount of interest will be charged on the amount unpaid Completion fee for ownership of the goods to pass to you – sometimes     you have to pay a balloon payment much higher than your usual     monthly payments Repossession charges - you could be charged for repossession costs or for     failure to take reasonable care Rescheduling charge - if your lender agrees to change the loan terms Any balloon payment charged on a hire purchase loan has the effect of postponing part of the costs until after the loan. This means that in the earlier months and years, you are paying less off your loan than you would for a bank or a credit union loan. You have to pay the balloon payment to clear the loan and to become the legal owner.",978
463,"A hire purchase agreement is drawn up and signed by you (the hirer) and on behalf of the owner (the finance company). If there is a retailer involved, for example, a garage, it also signs the agreement and supplies the items in question. The hire purchase must include: The item covered under the agreement, for example, a car or computer. The cash price of the item. The hire purchase price. This is the total amount you will pay over the     life of the loan. The hire purchase price is the monthly payment or     instalment multiplied by the number of instalments which you have to   make. The amount of each instalment you have to pay. Sometimes the final     instalment is much larger than all the others (a balloon   payment ). The date you must pay each instalment. The names and addresses of all the parties to the agreement. A statement that you have the right to withdraw from the agreement within     10 days of receiving a copy of the agreement. This is known as a cooling     off period. Often you are asked to give away this right by signing a     waiver. You do not have to sign this waiver. A statement that you must tell the owner (finance company) of the     locations of the item. The words ""Hire Purchase Agreement"" which must be stated clearly and in a     prominent place on the agreement form. The fees, charges, and penalties that apply. The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) charged (for agreements made since 16     May 2022). Unless all of these requirements are contained in the agreement, the agreement may not be legally enforceable. You should try to take some time to read all the terms of the agreement and make sure you understand these fully before you sign up.",1691
464,"You can end the agreement at any time by giving notice in writing to the owner of the goods (the finance company). This is a legal right under the Consumer Credit Act 1995. You should be aware that breaking a hire purchase contract before its normal end date usually involves penalties. You have two options: Buy the item earlier than planned. You can own the item     by paying the difference between the amount already paid and the total hire     purchase price. There is usually a reduction on the overall amount due as     you are paying the loan off earlier than planned. This reduction is     calculated using a recognised formula for early loan repayments. However,     the amount of any reduction is relatively small. Return the item to the owner and pay half the amount of the total     hire purchase price (if the total of instalments already paid have     not reached that amount). This is called the half-rule . You do not     have to pay half the hire purchase price immediately. If you have not paid half the hire purchase price you can still return the item. However, you will still owe the difference between the payments you have made and half the hire purchase price. If you have already paid more than half of the total hire purchase price, you will owe any arrears due up to the date of termination. You may have to pay damages for failure to take reasonable care. The finance company may issue a notice of costs, but you should try to get your own estimate before handing back the goods. Take photographs of the goods before handing them over. If you sign any paperwork, make sure it says ‘Statutory Termination’ and not ‘Voluntary Surrender’ because different calculations will usually be used to work out how much you owe. The CCPC has more information about the half rule and cancelling a HP agreement . Ending an agreement using the half rule may not always be the best solution. Contact MABS to talk through your options.",1947
465,"The finance company can only repossess (take back) the item under certain conditions: If you are in arrears and have not yet paid off one-third of the total     hire purchase cost, the owner can repossess the goods at any time without     taking legal action against you. They must send you a default     notice first and give you at least 21 days to put things right, unless     a court says they do not have to. If you have paid one-third or more off the total hire purchase cost, the     owner cannot repossess the goods without taking legal action. Any deposit that you pay at the start of the agreement or the value of any trade-in, for example, is taken into account in calculating one third of the cost. If this one-third rule is breached by the owner, you are entitled to end the agreement and can ask for a refund of all payments made. The CCPC has more information about the one-third rule (pdf) and you can contact MABS for free and confidential advice.",964

You can claim against either party in this situation. You cannot claim against the manufacturer of the item. If you return the defective item, you are entitled to a refund of any instalments paid. Consumer rights in this situation are the same as if the item was bought outright. A guarantee under a hire purchase agreement applies in the same way as if items were bought outright. The manufacturer makes the guarantee. If there is a fault with the item, you can choose to have the item repaired under the guarantee or to seek a full refund or exchange from the owner. Under a hire purchase agreement, you have a duty to take reasonable care of the hired item. If you damage the item and return them to the owner or finance company, they can send you a bill for repairs.",1335

If the bank decides that you will be able to repay an overdraft, it can make the option available on either a short-term or longer-term basis. There will be a limit to the amount of the overdraft. How much of an overdraft you get, if any, usually depends on how well you have managed your account in the past. For example, the bank will check whether you pay your bills regularly and pay off your credit card debt every month. If you have a bad credit history , you may find it difficult to get an overdraft. The bank will set a time limit for the overdraft to be fully repaid. The overdraft is paid back to the bank when money is put into your account. If you do not repay the overdraft in the agreed time, it can affect your credit history and make it harder to get loans or overdrafts in future. What if I can’t pay back an overdraft? Ask the bank for more time to pay back what you owe. The bank is likely to agree to a time extension if you have paid off your debts in the past. If you still cannot pay back the overdraft and are getting further into debt, contact MABS (the Money Advice and Budgeting Service ).

Occupational pension schemes provide a regular income after retirement. Some also give you a lump sum payment when you retire. There is no legal obligation on employers to provide occupational pension schemes for employees. In general, large employers in Ireland have occupational pension schemes, but many smaller employers do not. If your employer does not have an occupational pension scheme, they must give you access to a type of pension plan called a Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) .

500,"Occupational pension schemes may be: Contributory or non-contributory Funded or unfunded Defined benefit, defined contribution or a hybrid of both Contributory In contributory schemes, both you and your employer pay contributions towards the scheme. In non-contributory schemes, you do not contribute but your employer does. Funded schemes Most occupational schemes are funded – the contributions are put into a designated fund and the benefits are paid from that fund. The most notable exception is the public service pension arrangement, where there is no fund and benefits are paid out of current government funds. Defined benefit and defined contribution In a defined contribution scheme, the pension contributions you make are set and the benefits you get depend on the amount of the contributions you make. In a defined benefit scheme, the benefit you are entitled to is set in advance. It could, for example, be linked to your length of service. Occupational pension schemes can offer aspects of both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes. These are known as hybrid schemes. This means that you can predict a certain amount of income, as in a defined benefit scheme, and the remainder may vary as it will be subject to defined contribution rules.",1264
501,"A defined contribution scheme is where the contribution is fixed by agreement but the benefits are based on the value of the fund built up from the contributions. The value of the fund may change over time. This means that you do not know the amount of pension you will get. Both you and your employer pay regular contributions, normally a fixed percentage of your salary. This money creates a pension fund, which is normally invested to ensure that its real value is not reduced by inflation. Your pension fund at retirement may be worth less than the total value of your contributions, because: Investment performance may fall as well as rise Management fees are paid to the person or company managing the pension     fund",724
502,"A defined benefit scheme is where the benefit entitlement you get when you retire is defined by reference to your earnings, your length of service, an index, or a fixed amount. This means that you know in advance that your pension will be, for example, half of your final salary if you have 40 years’ service or that it will be a certain amount each week. In defined benefit schemes, the contributions may have to be varied from time to time to make sure that the fund can meet the level of benefits. Some schemes allow the employer to top up the fund if necessary. Rules on wind-up of defined benefit schemes When a defined benefit pension scheme is being wound up, its assets are distributed in a specific order of priority . If the scheme is fully funded then all liabilities are met, which means you will get the pension you expected from the scheme. If the pension scheme is underfunded or insolvent, then people with a lower order of priority do not get what they expected from the scheme. These rules differ depending on whether or not the employer is solvent. Single insolvency order – if the employer is solvent This order applies where the defined benefit scheme is insolvent but the employer is solvent. The first priority to be paid is additional voluntary contributions and defined contribution benefits. The second priority is the pensions payable to current pensioners but there are now limits on the amounts to which priority is attached as follows: The first €12,000 annually of pension 90% of pensions between €12,000 and €60,000 with a minimum of     €12,000 80% of pensions over €60,000 with a minimum of €54,000 The next priority is 50% of the pensions of future pensioners. After that, the priority is: The remaining pension of current pensioners Remaining pensions of future pensioners Any other remaining benefits This means that existing pensioners could have their current pensions reduced. Pensions under €12,000 may not be reduced. The maximum reduction is 10% of pensions under €60,000 (but they cannot be reduced to less than €12,000) and 20% of pensions over €60,000. Double insolvency order – if the employer is insolvent The priority in the winding up of a defined benefit pension scheme where the employer is insolvent is as follows: Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs) and defined contribution     benefits 50% of current pensioner and future pensioner benefits Pensioner benefits up to €12,000 a year Remaining benefits for current pensioners Remaining benefits for future pensioners Where the scheme does not have enough funds to pay 50% of pensioner and future pensioner benefits and pensioner benefits up to €12,000 a year, the Minister for Finance must provide the necessary funding.",2729

Your benefits from the pension scheme may be preserved within the scheme or transferred to another scheme. If you have at least 2 years service, you are entitled to a preserved benefit if you leave before the normal retirement age. A preserved benefit means that you get a pension when you reach the scheme's normal retirement age. You can also ask the trustees to transfer your pension rights to a new pension scheme.

For personal pension plans, the options available on retirement include: Purchasing an annuity Investing in an Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) Annuities With an annuity, you buy a regular pension income with all or part of your retirement fund. In return for you transferring your retirement fund to a life assurance company, the company will pay you a secure regular income for the rest of your life. The amount of this regular income depends on a number of things, including: The amount of your retirement fund Your age and health Whether you are male or female Whether your pension will continue to paid to any dependants on your   death The annuity rate that the life assurance company offers at that time Approved Retirement Funds An Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) is a personal retirement fund where you can keep your pension fund invested as a lump sum after retirement. You can withdraw money from it regularly to give yourself an income. Any money left in the fund after your death can be left to your next of kin. Because an ARF invests in various assets (such as shares, property, bonds and cash), your original investment is not guaranteed. This means there is a risk that your fund could get significantly smaller over time. Before 1 January 2022, if you had a guaranteed annual pension income of less than €12,700, you had to purchase an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF) which had extra restrictions on withdrawing funds.

The tax treatment of ARFs when you die depends on who inherits the ARF. Transfers to your spouse If the ARF transfers to your spouse, then no income tax or Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) is payable. However, your spouse will pay income tax on any withdrawals from the ARF. Transfers to your children If the ARF monies are inherited by your child, the taxation treatment depends on the child’s age at the time of your death.

Standard PRSAs are likely to meet the requirements of most people. The level of charges on your account is important to consider, as the charges imposed reduce the fund you can build up. On your retirement, the size of your fund will depend on your contributions and the investment performance less any charges. It is not possible to predict investment performance. Charges on Non-Standard PRSAs are not capped and in most cases, are higher than Standard PRSAs. If you are considering a Non-Standard PRSA, ask for a full explanation of the differences between this product and the Standard product. You should beware of promises of better returns on Non-Standard PRSA products as predicting investment performance is extremely difficult. Investment of your money Standard PRSAs invest only in pooled funds where the risk is spread across a large number and variety of investments. Non-Standard PRSAs can offer wider investment choices. However, you need to be sure that you understand the investment choices and the reasons why you should opt for them. If you do not understand how your pension will be invested, then you should consider if this product is best for you. You should also be sure that you can afford the monthly payment suggested and that this is the most effective payment for tax relief .",1719
521,"If you are considering whether to invest in a PRSA, you should ask yourself the following questions. Is there an existing pension scheme available to me in my job? If not, you should consider making provision for your retirement and a PRSA may be the option for you. If you already have a good pension arrangement, you may not need to make any additional provision, or you may be able to top up your benefits by making Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs). If there is no AVC facility, your employer must provide access to a PRSA. Should I start a PRSA if I already have a personal pension plan? You should seek professional advice based on your circumstances. Contact a broker or your pension provider for more information. Do I need a PRSA if I already have a defined benefit scheme? Defined benefit pension schemes promise a pension related to your salary (for example, two-thirds of final salary on retirement). You may not need to make any further pension provisions if you have this type of pension. Transferring from a defined benefit scheme into a PRSA involves a risk so you will need to assess your financial position and weigh up the advantages and disadvantages. Do I need a PRSA if I have a defined contribution scheme? A defined contribution scheme is also based on investment and has an investment risk - your pension will depend on the contributions you make, together with the investment performance of your fund, less any charges. If your employer is making a contribution to your existing scheme, you should find out whether this will continue if you transfer to a PRSA.",1594

For more information on the way in which pension income is taxed see our document on taxation of pensions . The rate of tax relief on your pension contributions is at the highest rate of income tax you pay, also known as the marginal rate. There are various rules that pension schemes must meet in order to get the tax relief and there is a limit to the amount of the relief. There is no relief on PRSI or the Universal Social Charge for employee pension contributions.",635
527,"There is a limit on the overall value of your pension fund that you can get tax relief on. This is called the Standard Fund Threshold. The absolute value of the Standard Fund Threshold is €2 million. If the fund is greater than the limit, then tax at 40% will be charged on the excess when it is drawn down from the fund. Annual limit There are limits to the amount of pension contributions you can get relief on in any one year: A maximum percentage of your income, depending on your age A limit to the amount of income that can be taken into account to     calculate the percentage The maximum amount of gross income taken into account to calculate the percentage is €115,000. The maximum percentage of gross income you can get relief on is:",743

If you are a sports person or a professional who usually retires at an earlier age than the norm, you can get tax relief on 30% of your net relevant earnings regardless of your age. If you have more than one source of income, the relief is only on the source of income that contributions are made from.",467
529,"When you retire, you can usually take part of your pension fund as a tax-free lump sum. The amount you can take depends on the type of pension plan you have and how much you have taken in tax-free lump sums from other pension plans. There is a limit of €200,000 on the amount of the tax-free retirement lump sum. Lump sum payments are taxed as follows:",352
530,The maximum tax-free lump sum payment from an occupational pension is 1.5 times your final salary and this amount is dependent on having a certain number of years of service. The maximum that can be taken as a tax-free lump sum from a Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) or Retirement Annuity Contract (RAC) is 25% of the fund.,334

533,"Occupational pensions are taxable. They are subject to tax under the PAYE (Pay As You Earn) system so the process is the same as applied when you were being paid your salary. If you have both an occupational pension and a social welfare pension, you may have to pay tax on both. Read more about taxation of social welfare payments . Occupational pensions are not subject to social insurance contributions (PRSI) but if you are aged under 66 you may have to pay PRSI on other income. Occupational pensions are subject to the Universal Social Charge (USC) . Many pensioners do not have to pay tax because the amount of their income is below the level that is taxable. There are additional tax credits for people aged over 65 and income exemption limits below which no tax is payable – read more about tax reliefs for people aged over 65 . Exempted pensions Income from the following sources is exempt from tax: Wound and disability pensions and all gratuities due to wounds or     disabilities granted under the Army Pensions Acts (any part that is not due     to disability is taxable) Military gratuities and demobilisation pay given to officers of the     National Forces or the Defence Forces of Ireland Pensions and other allowances payable to War of Independence veterans and     their families Magdalene Laundry payments Foreign occupational and social security pensions that would not be     taxable if the recipient lived in the country that granted them",1461
534,"Social welfare pensions paid by the Department of Social Protection are liable to income tax. They are not liable to USC or PRSI. The income tax is not deducted from your social welfare pension when it is paid to you but is paid with your other income tax. If you are self-employed, you include your social welfare payments on your income tax return (Form 11) and pay any tax due with your annual income tax payment. If you have income from employment or an occupational pension, you are taxed under the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) system. If you are a PAYE taxpayer, your tax credits and tax rate band are reduced to take account of the tax that is due on your social welfare pension. This means that the amount of tax due on your social welfare pension is deducted from your other income. The technical term for this is coding in of credits. If your social welfare pension is not coded in, you have to pay tax as a self-employed person in a lump sum by 31 October each year. If your non-pension income is not taxed on the PAYE system, for example if you have an occupational pension from abroad or you have investment income, then you are classed as a self-employed person and your tax is payable annually by 31 October each year.",1227
535,"Income that comes from abroad is generally taxable in Ireland if you are resident in Ireland. If you are living abroad and you receive your pension from Ireland, it may or may not be taxable under PAYE. If there is a Double Taxation Agreement, you may be exempted from Irish tax (but usually will be liable in the other country). If you are exempt from Irish tax, Revenue may tell your pension provider (for example, your former employer or the pension fund) not to deduct income tax under PAYE. If Revenue do not notify the payer of your pension, then PAYE must be deducted in the usual way. Certain foreign pensions that would be exempt from tax if you were resident in the country paying the pension are also exempt from tax in Ireland. If you are getting a foreign pension that would be exempt from tax if you were resident in the country paying it, you may also be exempt from paying tax on it in Ireland. Double Taxation Agreements Double Taxation Agreements generally make a distinction between pensions payable by governments to former employees and pensions payable by private employers. However, not all agreements make this distinction and they vary in other ways so you will need to check how an agreement may affect your situation. Most Double Taxation Agreements provide that pensions for non-governmental employees are taxed in the country of residence. So, if you are living in Ireland and getting an occupational pension from another country, you should generally receive it and then pay Irish tax on it. The opposite is the case for pensions for former Government employees – generally they are taxable only in the country where they are paid. So, if you are a former employee of the government of the United States of America and are now living in Ireland, you pay tax on your occupational pension only in the USA. In some cases, this applies to pensions from local authorities or other political sub-divisions – again, you need to check the particular agreement. Read more about Double Taxation Agreements.",2026

542,"Financial institutions such as banks, credit unions and building societies use different terms for the interest you are charged or earn on their financial products. The four most common terms you will see are: Annual Percentage Rate (APR) Equivalent Annual Rate (EAR) Annual Equivalent Rate (AER) Compound Annual Rate (CAR) APR and EAR are used for the interest you are charged on loans and overdrafts. AER, CAR and EAR can be used for the interest you earn on savings.",469
543,"The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is a calculation of the overall cost of your loan. It is an annual rate that represents the actual yearly cost of the funds borrowed. It takes into account all the costs during the term of the loan including any set up charges and the interest rate. This means that fees and charges are added to the loan amount before interest is calculated. APR is calculated each year on the reducing amount of the loan you still owe as you pay it back. The higher the APR the more it will cost you to borrow. All lenders must quote the interest rate on a loan or credit card as an APR. This requirement is in Section 21 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 . You can use the APR to compare loans once they are for the same amount and the same term. For example, a loan with an APR of 15% is more expensive than one with an APR of 11%. You cannot use APR to compare loans of different terms – if the terms are different you should look at the cost of credit. The cost of credit is the real cost of borrowing. It is the difference between the amount you borrow and the total you repay. The CCPC has a loan comparison tool that shows you the total cost and monthly repayments for personal loans that are available.",1226
544,"The Equivalent Annual Rate (EAR) can be used to calculate interest earned on an account that has money in it or interest charged on an account that is overdrawn. For example, a current account with an overdraft facility can have 2 EAR rates – one for interest paid when the account is in credit and another for interest charged when the account is overdrawn. If only one EAR is quoted you should find out whether it applies to your credit balance or your overdraft. Always check the interest rate charged on your overdraft facility with your bank. EAR takes into account when the interest is charged or earned, and any additional charges. Examples of additional charges are quarterly fees or set-up charges. EAR calculates the interest as if it is paid once a year, even if it is paid twice or three times per year. This allows you to use EAR rates to compare an account where the interest is paid or charged monthly with one where the interest is paid or charged annually. The higher the EAR, the more interest you will be charged or earn.",1040
545,"Annual Equivalent Rate (AER) and Compound Annual Rate (CAR) both show you the real interest you will earn on savings or interest-based investments at the end of a year. AER is the amount of interest earned in a year. AER is useful for comparing the return on savings accounts because it shows how much is earned regardless of how often interest is credited to an account. It is standard practice in Ireland to list interest as AER for savings accounts. You may earn less than the AER because your money may not be invested for a full year. AER is usually quoted without taking DIRT into account. Sometimes firms use Compound Annual Rate (CAR) instead of AER on savings and investment products, for example, tracker bonds. AER and CAR both take into account how often interest is paid because when the interest is added to your savings your savings increase. As a result, the next time the interest on your savings is calculated this increases too. This called compound interest – see example below. If a financial institution, quotes an AER or CAR rate for an account, there may also be terms and conditions attached to that account which can stop you from getting the full rate. For example, you may not get the full rate if you withdraw your savings before a certain date. AER and CAR do not take into account fees or charges. The CCPC has savings comparison tools that show you the rate and amount of interest paid by savings and deposit accounts that are available. Example of compound interest: If a financial institution quotes an interest rate of 4% per year compounded every 6 months, it pays 2% compound interest every 6 months. The amount of interest that is paid at the end of 6 months then earns interest for the second 6 months of the year. For this reason, 4% compounded every 6 months, is not the same as 4% compounded annually. For example, you invest €500 with your bank at a rate of 4% each year, compounded every 6 months. For the first 6 months, the interest of 2% on €500 gives €10. This interest is then added to the initial amount to give a running total of €510. The interest for the second 6 months of the year is 2% of €510 = €10.20. Added to the €10 for the first 6 months, this gives €20.20 for the year. The annual interest rate is therefore 20.20/500 x 100 = 4.04%.",2295
546,"If you receive a gift, you may have to pay gift tax on it. If you receive an inheritance following a death, it may be liable to inheritance tax. Both these taxes are types of Capital Acquisitions Tax. The benefit (the gift or inheritance) is taxed if its value is over a certain limit or threshold. Different tax-free thresholds apply depending on the relationship between the disponer (the person giving the benefit) and the beneficiary (the person receiving the benefit). There are also a number of exemptions and reliefs that depend on the type of the gift or inheritance. If you receive a gift or inheritance from your spouse or civil partner, you are exempt from Capital Acquisitions Tax. The tax applies to all property that is located in Ireland. It also applies where the property is not located in Ireland but either the person giving the benefit or the person receiving it are resident or ordinarily resident in Ireland for tax purposes.",947
547,"Gifts and inheritances can be received tax-free up to a certain amount. The tax-free amount, or threshold, varies depending on your relationship to the person giving the benefit. There are three different categories or groups. Each has a threshold that applies to the total benefits you have received in that category since 5 December 1991. Group A applies where the beneficiary, the person receiving the benefit, is a child of the person giving it. This includes a stepchild or an adopted child. It can also include a foster child if the foster child resided with and was under the care of the disponer and they provided the care, at their expense, for a period or periods totalling at least 5 years before the foster child reached the age of 18. This minimum period does not apply in the case of an inheritance taken on the date of death of the disponer. In this case the Group A threshold will apply provided that the foster child had been placed in the care of the disponer prior to that date. Group A also applies to parents who take an inheritance from their child but only where the parent takes full and complete ownership of the inheritance. If a parent receives an inheritance where they do not have full and complete ownership of the benefit, or if a parent receives a gift, then Group B applies. If a parent inherits from their child, and they have full and complete ownership of the inheritance it is exempt from tax if, in the previous five years, the child took an inheritance or gift from either parent and it was not exempt from Capital Acquisitions Tax. In this case, no tax needs to be paid even if the inheritance from the child is over the threshold. Group B applies where the beneficiary is the: Parent - see also Group A above Grandparent Grandchild or great-grandchild - see below Brother or sister Nephew or niece of the giver - see below If a grandchild is a minor (under 18 years of age) and takes a gift or inheritance from their grandparent Group A may apply if the grandchild's parent is deceased. Group A may apply to a nephew or niece if they have worked in the business of the person giving the benefit for the previous five years and meets the following criteria: The nephew or niece must be a blood relation rather than a nephew or niece-in-law The gift or inheritance consists of property used in connection with the business, including farming, or of shares in the company. If the gift or inheritance consists of property then the nephew or niece must work more than 24 hours a week for the disponer at a place where the business is carried on, or for the company if the gift or inheritance is shares. But if the business is carried on exclusively by the disponer, their spouse and the nephew or niece then the requirement is that the nephew or niece work more than 15 hours a week. The relief does not apply if the benefit is taken under a discretionary trust. Group C applies to any relationship not included in Group A or Group B. If you receive a benefit from a relation of your deceased spouse or civil partner, you can be assessed with the same group as your spouse or civil partner would have been if they were receiving the benefit from their relation. For example, if you receive a benefit from the father of your spouse or civil partner, the group threshold would be Group C. But if you receive a benefit from the father of your spouse or civil partner and your spouse or civil partner is deceased, then the group threshold that applies to you would be the same as for a child receiving a benefit from a parent, Group A.",3567

550,"The valuation date is the date on which the market value of the property comprising the gift or inheritance is established. In the case of a gift , the valuation date is normally the date of the gift. In the case of an inheritance , the valuation date is normally the earliest of the following dates: The date the inheritance can be set aside for or given to the beneficiary The date it is actually retained for the benefit of the beneficiary The date it is transferred or paid over to the beneficiary The valuation date will normally be the date of death in the following circumstances: Gift made in contemplation of death (Donatio Mortis Causa) Where a power of revocation has not been exercised. This could arise where a person makes a gift of property but reserves the power to revoke, or take back, the gift. If they die and this power ceases, the recipient then becomes taxable as inheriting the benefit. If the beneficiary had free use of the benefit before this, they will be taxed as receiving a gift of the value of the use of the property.",1050
551,"The gift or inheritance is valued as the market value at the time you become entitled to the use or benefit of it. The value that is taxable is the market value minus the following deductions. You can deduct any liabilities, costs and expenses that are properly payable. This would include debts that must, by law, be paid and that are payable out of the benefit or because of it. With an inheritance, these may be funeral expenses, the costs of administering the estate, or debts owed by the deceased. For a gift, they could include legal costs or stamp duty. If you make a payment for the benefit or some other contribution in return for it, this may also be deducted. This is known as a 'consideration' and could be, for example, a part payment, an amount paid annually to the donor or other person, or a payment of debts of the donor. If you do not receive full ownership but instead receive a benefit for a limited period, then a number of factors are taken into account to calculate the value. More information on the calculation of the value of a limited interest is explained on revenue.ie .",1099
552,"Capital Acquisitions Tax is charged at 33% on gifts or inheritances made on or after 5 December 2012 (the rate was formerly 30%). This only applies to amounts over the group threshold. For example, if you have received gifts from your parents with a taxable value of €550,000, you only pay tax on the amount over the appropriate group threshold (Group A threshold since 9 October 2019: €335,000). So €215,000 is taxed at 33%.",425

However, if the employee is a relative of the employer, or the employer is a private company and the employee is deemed to control the company, Revenue may disallow this exemption if they consider the payment excessive. Reasonable support for the maintenance or education of a child or spouse or civil partner. Other exemptions The first €3,000 of the total value of all gifts received from any one person in any calendar year is exempt. So, you could receive a gift from several people in the same calendar year and the first €3,000 from each person is exempt from CAT. This exemption does not apply to inheritances. If you receive a gift or inheritance of a house that has been your main residence, it may be exempt from tax if you do not own or have an interest in any other house. There are conditions on how long you must be resident in the house before and after receiving the benefit. More information about the Dwelling House Exemption is available on Revenue's website and in Revenue's Operational Manual (pdf). If a parent receives an inheritance from their child, and takes full and complete ownership of the inheritance, it is usually taxable under Group A. But it is exempt if, in the previous 5 years, the child took an inheritance or gift from either parent and it was not exempt from Capital Acquisitions Tax. Payments that reduce the debt of a bankrupt or near-bankrupt are usually exempt ( Section 82, Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 ).

555,"If you have received a gift or inheritance, then you are responsible for paying any Capital Acquisitions Tax that is due. If you are not resident in Ireland, you must get an agent who is resident in Ireland, such as a solicitor, to take responsibility for the payment of CAT. You must make a tax return if the total value of gifts and inheritances you have received in one of the groups, A, B or C, since 5 December 1991 is more than 80% of the tax-free threshold for that group. For example, if you received a gift of €20,000 from a brother and then an inheritance of €10,000 from a grandparent, both of these benefits would come under Group B and amount to a total of €30,000. The threshold for Group B is currently €32,500 and 80% of this is €26,000. Because the benefits you received exceed 80% of the tax-free threshold for Group B, you are required to make a tax return even though the total amount received is below the threshold. Making your return online Gift and inheritance tax returns must be made electronically using Revenue’s Online Service . Revenue provide a guide to filing your gift or inheritance tax return . There are some exceptions where a paper gift and inheritance tax return ( Form IT38S (pdf) ) is available. It can only be used by you, the taxpayer, if you meet the following criteria: You are not claiming any relief, exemption or credit, apart from small gift exemption . The benefit taken is an absolute interest without conditions or restrictions. The property included in the return was taken from only one disponer and is not part of a larger benefit. Pay and File dates for CAT Taxable gifts or inheritances with a valuation date on or after 14 June 2010 have a fixed CAT pay and file date. All gifts and inheritances with a valuation date in the 12-month period ending on the 31 August must be paid and filed by 31 October. This means, if the valuation date is between 1 January and 31 August, you must complete the tax return and pay the tax on or before 31 October in that year. If the valuation date is between 1 September and 31 December, you must complete the tax return and pay the tax on or before 31 October in the following year. If you pay and file your tax return online using the Revenue Online Service (ROS) , the deadline for filing your return is usually slightly later. There is a surcharge for late pay and file of CAT. The surcharge is based on a percentage of the total tax payable for the year the return is late and graded according to the length of the delay. However, there is an overall cap on the level of the surcharge which is calculated as follows: 5% surcharge to a maximum of €12,695, if you complete the tax return and pay the tax within 2 months of the pay and file date. 10% surcharge up to a maximum of €63,485, if you do not complete the tax return and pay the tax within 2 months of the pay and file date. Special circumstances In certain circumstances, it is possible to pay the tax by instalments over a period not exceeding 60 months. This applies to any property where the beneficiary does not have full and complete ownership. It also applies if the benefit is full and complete ownership of the following: Property which cannot be moved (for example, lands or a house) or Property which can be moved and is agricultural or business property Revenue can consider allowing a postponement of tax due if there is hardship involved.

If the property is held for more than 7 years, relief will be given for the first 7 years. If the property is held for less than 7 years but more than 4 years, and is disposed of after 1 January 2018, it is exempt from CGT. For example, if the property was bought in January 2012 and sold in January 2022, the property would have been held for 10 years, so 7/10 of any gain will be relieved from CGT and 3/10 is taxable.

571,"A credit card is a plastic card issued by a financial institution that allows you to obtain goods, services or cash up to a stipulated credit limit. You then pay the credit card company for the amount of the total transactions you charge on the card. Interest is charged on any outstanding balance each month. A charge card can be used like a credit card except no interest is charged since balances are paid by you at the end of each month. The stamp duty is payable annually as follows: Credit cards: €30 Charge cards: €30 The charge is for each account. You can have additional cards issued on an account without paying extra duty. Companies that have a number of cards on one account must pay the duty on each card. Stamp duty is generally collected on 1 April for the previous year. The tax year for the stamp duty begins on April 2. If the credit card account is closed and has never been used, no stamp duty is payable, provided that you close the account in the same period as it was opened. If you don't close the account in the period it was opened, you will be charged stamp duty on it even if it has never been used. If you have used your card and you close your account during the year, you will be charged stamp duty on closure. If you are changing to a different credit card account, you don’t have to pay the duty again for that year. When you are closing the account your card issuer will give you a letter of closure stating that you have paid your stamp duty for the year. If you give this letter to your new card issuer, you will not be charged stamp duty by them for that year.

574,"VAT is a tax on consumer spending, so everyone who pays for goods and services pays VAT. It is built into the cost of many commonly consumed items such as clothing and petrol, so you don’t see what percentage of VAT you are paying. However, when you are buying some items or services, such as electricity and professional services, you may see the amount of VAT and the rate at which you are being charged on your bill. VAT is charged at every stage of sale where the cost of an item is increased. The current standard rate of VAT is 23%. Example A manufacturer sells a television to a wholesaler for €100 and charges him VAT on that amount at 23%. Therefore, the wholesaler pays €123 for the television. The manufacturer then pays the VAT of €23 to the government. The wholesaler goes on to sell the television to a retailer for €200. He adds on VAT at 23%, so the retailer pays a total of €246. The wholesaler must pay the government the VAT of €46, but he can reclaim the €23 VAT he has already paid to the manufacturer, leaving €23, which he pays to the government. When the retailer comes to sell the television to a consumer, he must also add on VAT to his selling price. He sells the television for €300, plus VAT at 23%, making a selling price of €369 for the consumer. The retailer must pay the VAT to the government but he can claim back the €46 VAT that he paid to the wholesaler, leaving €23 for the government. The government has now received 23% on the price paid for the television by the consumer (€69). The retailer, wholesaler and manufacturer only paid the amount of VAT they charged to the next group down the line.",1635
575,"This section only deals with VAT for consumers who buy goods for personal use. In general, you have to pay VAT and import duty on any goods you are bringing into Ireland from outside the European Union (EU). This includes goods purchased online and by mail order. You will have to pay VAT at the same rate as applies in Ireland for similar goods. Within the EU, VAT is usually paid in the member state you purchased the goods, however, there are some exceptions - see below. If you buy online From outside the EU From 1 July 2021, the VAT exemption on goods up to a value of €22 from outside the EU no longer applies. All goods arriving into Ireland from non-EU countries are subject to VAT. Some online retailers are registered with the Import One Stop Shop (IOSS) so that VAT can be included in the price you pay for the goods. Before you make a purchase, check whether the advertised price includes tax and duty costs. Customs duty is charged on goods with a value over €150. Excise Duty is payable on alcohol and tobacco products and is separate from Customs Duty. Revenue has a guide to buying goods from outside the EU for personal use including information on how to calculate what you owe in duties and taxes. From another EU Member State If you buy goods online or by mail from another EU member state you may pay VAT at the rate that applies in Ireland. However, if the supplier that you are buying the goods from has not exceeded the Distance Sales Threshold in Ireland then you will pay VAT at the rate that would apply in the country of purchase. You will usually be told the amount of VAT payable at checkout. Excisable products (for example, alcohol, tobacco and oil) purchased within the EU via the internet or by mail are subject to excise duty and VAT. Travelling with your purchases From outside the EU You can buy and bring your goods (other than tobacco and alcohol products) from a non-EU State into Ireland without paying any taxes, if their value is no more than: €430 if you are aged over 15 €215 if you are aged under 15 You will have to pay VAT and customs duty on anything over these amounts. If you bring in an item worth more than the €430 or €215 limit, you must pay import charges on the full value. Revenue has information if you arriving in Ireland from countries outside the EU . From another EU Member State There are no limits on what you can buy and take with you when you travel between EU countries, as long as the products you bought are for your own personal use and not for resale. VAT is included in the price of the product in the EU member state and no further payment of taxes including VAT can be charged here in Ireland. The exception to this is where you are importing a vehicle from the EU. Special rules apply in the case of goods subject to excise duty, such as alcohol and tobacco products. Revenue has published information if you are arriving in Ireland from the EU . Gifts from outside the EU You can receive a gift from outside the EU up to the value of €45 without paying import charges. However, the gift must be correctly declared.

Interest will continue to be charged on the deferred amount in the usual way. If you inherit a property from someone who is not your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant, Revenue may allow the deferral to continue if you apply for a deferral and qualify.

If you do not agree with a Revenue estimate you can replace it by submitting a return with your own self-assessment. Since Revenue has compiled a register of residential properties from various sources, there may be errors about ownership of some properties. If you got a LPT return form and you do not think you are liable for that property you should contact Revenue within 30 days of getting the letter. You should include an explanation of why you are not liable, the details who you think is the liable person (name, address and PPS Number) and supporting documentation. It is important that you contact Revenue because if the error is not corrected you are liable to pay the tax. Revenue will use the information you supply to make a decision on whether you are a liable person. If you do not agree you can appeal this decision to the Tax Appeal Commission. Appeals relating to the valuation of properties are decided by the Land Values Reference Committee. If you disagree with Revenue on other matters (for example, whether the property is residential or whether you can defer payment) and the matter cannot be resolved, Revenue will issue a formal Notice of Assessment or a formal decision on the matter to you. Your right to appeal to the Appeal Commissioners will be set out clearly on the notices. However, you must make a return and pay any tax due before you can appeal the Notice of Assessment or any other Revenue decision.

This means that the first €40,000 is taxed at the standard rate of tax, 20%, and the remainder (€3,200) is taxed at the higher rate of tax, 40%. €40,000 x 20% = €8,000 €3,200 x 40% = €1,280 Total = €9,280 Tax credits are deducted from this amount to give the tax due. A single PAYE (Pay As You Earn) taxpayer is entitled to Single Person Tax Credit = €1,775 Employee (PAYE) Tax Credit = €1,775 Total = €3,550 In this example, the taxpayer is not entitled to any other tax credits so the total tax due is: Gross tax of €9,280 Minus tax credits of €3,550 Tax due = €5,730 The USC on gross income is also payable. USC = €1,190.82 USC is calculated as follows: The person pays USC at a rate of 0.5% on the first €12,012 (which comes to €60.06), 2% on the next €10,908 (which comes to €218.16) and 4.5% on the balance of €20,280 (which comes to €912.60).

The tax relief you get depends on your income and whether you pay the standard 20% rate of income tax or the higher 40% rate of income tax. If you only pay the 20% rate of tax on your income, then there is no difference between your 20% income tax and the 20% you deducted from the payment. This means there is no benefit of tax relief. If you pay the higher 40% rate of tax on your income, the tax relief you get is the difference between the 40% you usually pay and the 20% you deducted from the payment. So, you can get tax relief of 20%. If you get a payment under a deed of covenant, tax has been deducted at 20%.

651,"In Ireland, most benefits from employment that are provided in addition to pay are subject to income tax. This also applies to benefits-in-kind. Benefits-in-kind are benefits received by an employee that cannot be converted into cash but that have a cash value. Examples include provision of a company car, loans given at a special rate or provision of accommodation. Some benefits-in-kind are exempt from tax or can be received tax efficiently. You can find information on benefits-in-kind and how they are taxed . If you are teleworking, that is, using a computer to work from home, your employer may provide you with a computer, printer or other equipment. In this case, the equipment provided is not assessed for tax as a benefit-in-kind so long as it is used primarily for business use. If your employer provides expenses to cover costs such as heating and light, these can be paid without being taxed. See Revenue's website for more information on working from home .",973
652,"Some work expenses can be deducted from your income before it is assessed for tax. To qualify, the expenses must have been necessary in order to do your work and must have been spent entirely for that purpose and no other. A mileage allowance that you receive for the use of your car for business purposes is not taxable if it does not exceed the civil service mileage rates . There is no tax relief on expenses for getting to or from work. The Bike to Work Scheme is a tax incentive scheme which aims to encourage employees to cycle to and from work. Under the scheme employers can pay for bicycles and bicycle equipment for their employees and the employee pays back through a salary sacrifice arrangement of up to 12 months. The employee is not liable for tax, PRSI or the Universal Social Charge on their repayments. See Revenue for more details on expenses that can be deducted for tax purposes including flat-rate expenses . Flat-rate expenses are directly related to the nature of the employment. A standard flat rate expenses allowance (deduction) (pdf) is set for various classes of employee. The agreed deduction is then applied to all employees of the class or group in question.",1190

654,"If you are resident in Ireland and commute daily or weekly to your place of work in another country where you pay tax, then you may qualify for Trans-border Workers Relief. This reduces your tax in Ireland to take account of the tax that you have paid abroad. It does this by reducing the tax you pay in Ireland on your total income so that it is in proportion to the amount of income from Irish sources. For example, take the case where your total income was €50,000, of which €5,000 was earned in Ireland and the remainder (€45,000) was earned and taxed abroad. The proportion of your total income that is Irish income is 1/10 (5,000 divided by 50,000). Your Irish income tax liability is calculated as usual on the full amount of your income, €50,000. But under Trans-border Workers Relief, this amount of tax is then divided by ten to give the tax that you have to pay in Ireland. There are certain conditions on the duration and place of employment.

661,"You may have extra costs when you are working from home including heating, electricity and broadband costs. Your employer can pay you a contribution towards these costs or you can make a claim for tax relief during the year or after the end of the year. If your employer pays you a working from home allowance towards these expenses, you can get up to €3.20 per day without paying any tax, PRSI or USC on it. If your employer pays more than €3.20 per day to cover expenses, you pay tax, PRSI and USC as normal on the amount above €3.20. You should note that employers are not legally obliged to make this payment to their employees. If your employer does not pay you a working from home allowance for your expenses, you can make a claim for tax relief during the year or after the end of the year. You will get money back from the taxes you paid. If you share your bills with someone else, the cost is divided between you, based on the amount paid by each person (see Example 2 below). The amount of costs you can claim is based on: How many days you worked from home The cost of your expenses The percentage of your costs that Revenue counts as working from home     expenses You can claim relief on costs at the following rates: For 2022 and 2023, 30% for electricity, heating and internet costs For 2020 and 2021, 30% for internet costs and 10% for electricity and     heating costs For 2019, 10% for electricity and heating costs only You can only claim for the days that you work from home. This does not include times you may have brought work home to do outside your normal working hours. Your annual costs are taken into account but you only get relief for the proportion of the days you spent working from home during the year. For example, in 2023 the proportion would be the number of days working from home divided by 365. For 2020, it was a leap year so you divide by 366.",1885
662,"For 2022 and 2023 , to calculate the amount of costs you can get tax relief on: Add your electricity, heating and internet costs and multiply the total     costs by the number of days worked at home Divide by 365 Multiply by 30% (0.3) For the years 2020 and 2021 , the relief for internet was 30%, as above. However, the relief for electricity and heating was 10%, so these costs would be calculated as follows: Add the costs for electricity and heating and multiply the total costs by     the number of days worked at home Divide by 365 (or 366 in 2020) Multiply by 10% (0.1) For the years 2018 and 2019 , the relief for electricity and heating was also 10%, and calculated in the same way, but there was no relief for internet costs. Amount of tax relief When you know the amount of costs that you can get tax relief on you can calculate your tax savings. You get tax relief on the amount of your costs at a rate of 20% or 40%, whichever is the highest rate of income tax you pay. If your employer pays you an allowance towards your expenses, that amount paid is deducted from the amount you can claim back from Revenue. Example 1 Mary worked from home for 9 months in 2021 while her office was closed due to COVID-19. To make a claim, Mary needs to work out how many working days she worked from home. She should exclude weekends, public holidays and any annual leave taken during the 9 months she worked from home. Her total working days are 168. During 2021, her household bills for heating and electricity come to €1500 and her broadband comes to €450. To find out how much tax she can claim back, she: Multiplies the amount due on the electricity and heating bills by the     number of days she worked at home (€1500 x 168 = 252,000) Then, she divides her answer by 365 (252,000 / 365 = €690) Lastly, she calculates 10% of this amount to find out what she can claim     for heating and electricity (10% of €689 is €69 ) Mary uses the same method to see how much tax she can claim back on broadband. €450 (broadband bill) x 168 (days worked) = 75,600 75,600 divided by 365 = €207 Revenue will let Mary claim 30% of the cost of broadband in 2021. 30% of     €207 is €62 . This means, at the end of 2021, Mary can claim tax back on expenses of: €69 for heating and electricity €62 for broadband €131 in total The amount she gets back depends on her rate of tax. If she pays tax at the higher tax rate of 40% she will get €52.40 back from her taxes (40% of €131). If she pays tax at the lower rate of 20%, she will get €26.20 back (20% of €131). Example 2 Sharon and Lar are married and both worked from home for 181 days in 2020 while their offices were closed due to COVID-19. Their household bills for heating and electricity come to €1,950 and their broadband comes to €600. They split the bills equally between them and each calculate the portion they can claim. ( Note: when calculating relief for 2020, divide by 366 days because it was a leap year. For other years, divide by 365 days.) Cost of electricity and heat Amount paid each €975 x 181 = 176,475 Divided by 366 = €482 10% allowable cost = €48 Cost of broadband Amount paid each €300 x 181 = 54,300 Divided by 366 = €148 30% allowable cost = €45 At the end of the year, Sharon and Lar can each claim tax back on expenses of: €48 for heating and electricity €45 for broadband €93 in total The amount they gets back depends on their rate of tax. If they pay tax at the higher tax rate of 40% they will each get €37.20 back (40% of €93). If they pay tax at the lower rate of 20%, they will each get €18.60 back (20% of €93).",3589

683,"Tax is calculated as a percentage of your income. Your tax credits are deducted from this to give the amount of tax that you have to pay. A tax credit will reduce your tax by the amount of the credit. Everyone is entitled to a personal tax credit. There are personal tax credits for: Single people People who are married or in a civil partnership People who are widowed or are surviving civil partners If you are in employment, getting a pension or getting a taxable social welfare payment (such as Jobseeker’s Benefit) you are also entitled to the Employee Tax Credit (formerly known as the PAYE tax credit) of €1,775. So, for example, if you are single and in employment you are entitled to an annual tax credit of €1,775 and the Employee Tax Credit of €1,775. When the total amount of tax you owe is calculated, €3,550 will be deducted from this. This means that if you earn €17,000 or less you do not pay any income tax (because your tax credits of €3,550 are more than or equal to the amount of tax you are due to pay). However you may need to pay a Universal Social Charge (if your income is over €13,000) and PRSI (depending on how much you earn each week). If you are married or in a civil partnership, you have the option of sharing tax credits and tax bands between you and your spouse or civil partner. If one spouse or civil partner works in the home, caring for one or more dependent people, you may be able to claim a Home Carer Tax credit . You can read more about taxation of married people and civil partners .",1527
684,"In some cases, you can get a tax refund for specific expenses, for example, medical expenses or mortgage interest. The value of a tax allowance will depend on whether it is allowed at the highest rate of income tax that you pay or is restricted to the standard 20% rate. Take the example of a claim of €100. If you pay tax at 40% and you can claim it at this rate, then it will reduce your tax by €40 (€100 x 40%). If the highest rate of tax that you pay is 20%, or the relief is restricted to the standard rate, then the claim of €100 will reduce your tax by €20 (€100 x 20%). More information about how tax credits and allowances work is available in our document about how your income tax is calculated .",707
685,"One-parent families If you are caring for a dependent child on your own you can claim the Single Person Child Carer Credit in addition to your personal tax credit.

688,"The effect of separation on each spouse's tax liability depends chiefly on whether there are any maintenance payments involved and, if so, whether these payments are made under a legally enforceable arrangement or not. If maintenance payments are made, for the benefit of a spouse, under a legally enforceable arrangement during the year in which the couple separates then: The spouse who makes the payments is entitled to a tax deduction for the     payments The spouse to whom the maintenance is paid is taxed on the payments. Where a couple separates and no maintenance payments are made, each spouse is taxed as a single person and is responsible for filing his/her own tax return and paying tax on his/her own income. You can read more on Revenue's website about what to do about tax on the breakdown of a marriage, civil partnership or cohabiting relationship to find out about the tax treatment of civil partners.",920
689,"Tax treatment of voluntary maintenance payments Voluntary maintenance payments (i.e., payments that are not legally enforceable) are not taken into account when calculating either spouse's tax. This means that: The spouse who makes the payments is not entitled to a tax deduction for     them The spouse who receives the payments is not taxed on them Both spouses are taxed on their own income as single people. Where a spouse: Makes voluntary maintenance payments to the other spouse and Is not entitled to a tax deduction for the payments because they were not     made under a legally enforceable arrangement and The payments are sufficient to either wholly or mainly maintain his/her     spouse, he/she will qualify for the married person's tax credit but only the single person's standard rate cut-off point is due. The other spouse can also claim the single person's tax credit against his/her own income (if any). ""Mainly Maintaining"" means that the payer's maintenance payments exceed the recipient's income. Legally enforceable maintenance arrangements Legally enforceable maintenance arrangements include annual or periodic maintenance payments made under an order of court, deed of separation, rule of court, trust, covenant or any other act that gives rise to a legally enforceable obligation . The maintenance arrangement must be made or carried out in consideration or in consequence of a separation. Maintenance payments that are made under a legally enforceable arrangement entered into on or after 8 June 1983 are payable without deduction of tax. The following rules apply to maintenance payments made for the benefit of a spouse: The payments are made without deduction of tax (gross) The spouse who makes the payments is entitled to a tax deduction for them The spouse who receives the maintenance payments is liable for tax on     them Both spouses are taxed as single people (unless they choose to be taxed     as a married couple). A separated couple can choose to be treated as a married couple for income tax purposes if: They are both resident in the State and Maintenance payments are made under a legally enforceable arrangement. The couple must submit a joint election in writing if they wish to avail of this option. The election must be made in writing before the end of the tax year and must be signed by both parties. If such an election is made, the maintenance payments are ignored, i.e., the spouse making the payments does not get a tax deduction for them and the spouse who receives the payments is not liable for tax on them. Where both spouses possess income, separate assessment will apply, i.e., tax credits and standard rate cut-off point will be apportioned between the spouses, subject to a review at the end of the year to ensure that any unused tax credit or relevant rate bands are given to the other spouse. Where only one spouse has income, the full tax credits, reliefs and the maximum standard rate cut-off point (for couples with one spouse working) will be given to that spouse. For details and examples of the different types of assessment see Taxation of married people and civil partners in Ireland . Maintenance payments that are made for the benefit of a child or children are ignored for tax purposes: The payments are made without deduction of tax (gross) The person making the payments is not entitled to a tax     deduction for the payments The payments are not taxable The payments are not regarded as income of the child. Each spouse may be entitled to claim an Incapacitated Child Credit (or see Leaflet IT18 (pdf) ). The Single Person Child Carer Credit (SPCCC) can be claimed by the person with whom the child or children live for the whole or greater part of the year (more than 6 months) – called the primary claimant. A primary claimant can surrender his or her entitlement to the credit, in favour of a secondary claimant (provided the child (or children) lives with that person for more than 100 days in a year and the person meets all the other qualifying conditions.) If you are receiving maintenance payments and you also have income that is subject to PAYE, it may be possible to collect some or all of the tax due on the maintenance by reducing your tax credits. If you are receiving maintenance payments only, the tax due is payable directly in one lump sum under the self assessment procedures. In calculating your finances, you should take into account the payment of any tax that is due and the fact that this amount may have to be paid in one lump sum. Where a couple obtain an Irish divorce, the provisions as outlined above will apply to any maintenance arrangements made by order of the court, which means that: Maintenance payments are made without deduction of tax The spouse who makes the payments is entitled to a tax deduction for them The spouse who receives the maintenance is taxable on the payments Both spouses are taxed as single persons. A divorced couple also has the option of being treated as a married couple (the separate assessment provisions will apply) for income tax purposes if: They are both resident in the State and Neither spouse has remarried. Annullment of marriage If a marriage is annulled, each spouse will be taxed as a single person from the date of the annullment onwards. The couple cannot make an election for joint assessment.",5349

693,"If you expect that your income for the year will be less than these limits, you should contact Revenue and they will issue a revised determination of tax credits to you. If your income is not much above these amounts, you may get what is called ""marginal relief"". That means that you do not go back into the normal tax system - instead you pay tax at a rate of 40% on the amount by which your income exceeds your relevant exemption. The point at which marginal relief ceases to be of benefit varies with your family circumstances and the tax credits to which you are entitled. You can find more information about income tax exemptions and marginal relief on Revenue's website . Tax credits Tax credits are only relevant if you have a taxable income. Tax credits reduce the amount of income tax that you have to pay. How your tax is calculated depends on your income. Your tax credits are deducted from the gross tax to get the amount of tax that you have to pay. Everyone is entitled to a personal tax credit at either the married/in a civil partnership, single or widowed/surviving civil partner rate. People who pay tax under the PAYE (pay-as-you-earn) system also get an Employee Tax Credit (formerly known as the PAYE tax credit). This Employee Tax Credit is also available to pensioners who receive their social security pension from another EU member state; they do not pay tax at source but pay tax annually. People aged 65 and over also get an Age Tax Credit. Age Tax Credit This is additional to the personal tax credit and may be claimed once you or your spouse or civil partner reaches the age of 65.",1611

Dependent Relative Tax Credit This credit is granted to if you pay tax and maintain, at your own expense, any person who comes within any of the following categories: A relative, including a relative of your spouse or civil partner, who is     unable to maintain himself or herself as a result of old age or   ill-health A widowed parent / surviving civil partner parent of either yourself or     your spouse or civil partner, irrespective of the state of his/her   health A son or daughter of either yourself or your spouse or civil partner who     lives with you and on whose services you must depend as a result of old age     or ill health The relative's own income must be below a certain amount to claim this tax credit.

Relief for employing a carer If you employ a person to take care of an incapacitated member of your family, you may be eligible for tax relief. Revenue set a maximum amount at which you can claim . Covenants If you are a higher rate taxpayer and you want to help support a person on a low income, it may be worthwhile to covenant the money. The person to whom you covenant must be 65 or over or be permanently incapacitated. If the conditions are met, you can claim tax relief on an amount up to 5% of your taxable income; however, there is no limit if the person is permanently incapacitated. Covenants are most effective if the recipient does not have a taxable income. The amount you covenant may be taxable in the hands of the recipient. It is important to note that money covenanted to people receiving a non-contributory pension or means-tested allowance may affect their entitlement to the allowance in question. You can find more information about deeds of covenant . Deposit Interest Retention Tax Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) is deducted from the interest payable on savings in banks, building societies, etc. This happens whether or not you would normally be liable for tax.

You cannot claim the SPCCC for the year in which you become widowed or a surviving civil partner (the year of bereavement). You can claim the SPCCC in subsequent years if you qualify. Primary claimant The primary claimant is the person with whom a qualifying child (see below) lives for more than 6 months of the year. If both parents have equal custody (by court order), entitlement to the credit is decided by which parent gets Child Benefit from the Department of Social Protection. A child who is living away from home while attending college is considered a qualifying child if they are still maintained by the claimant and return home outside of term-time. Secondary claimant A primary claimant can give up the SPCCC to a secondary claimant . A secondary claimant must meet exactly the same conditions except for the condition that the child lives with him or her for the greater part of the year. The secondary claimant does not need to have legal custody of the qualifying child but must prove that the child lives with them for at least 100 days in the year. A day can be counted if the child stays with them for most of that day. So, for example, if a child stays with them from Saturday morning until Sunday evening, this can be counted as 2 days. Qualifying child A qualifying child is a child who is either: Born in the tax year Aged under 18 at the start of the tax year Aged over 18 at the start of the tax year but in full-time education   or Eligible for the Incapacitated     Child Tax Credit The child may be: Your own child. An adopted child. Any child you support and maintain at your own expense. This means having     day-to-day responsibility for the upbringing of the child and     responsibility for their charge and care. However, foster children children     do not qualify for SPCCC. Surrendering your entitlement If you are the primary claimant and you do not want to claim the credit, you can surrender (give up) your entitlement to the credit. This surrender will remain in place until you withdraw it. You will then have the credit restored to you at the beginning of the following tax year. (For example, if you withdraw your surrender on 15 May 2023, the SPCCC will be restored for the tax years from 2024 onwards). Can both parents claim a Single Person Child Carer Credit? Only one credit for any qualifying child is available to the primary claimant. If you have more than one qualifying child, you can only get one Single Person Child Carer Credit for those children. However, if you have more than one qualifying child and you surrender your entitlement to the SPCCC, then 2 or more secondary claimants can claim the credit if they each care for a qualified child for more than 100 days in a year. For example, Jack has 2 children, Susan and Joan, and is a qualifying primary claimant. Susan lives with her mother Mary for more than 100 days in a year and Joan lives with her mother Denise for more than 100 days in a year. If Jack surrenders his entitlement to the SPCCC, Mary and Denise can each claim a SPCCC if they meet the other requirements.",3357

You cannot surrender the SPCCC to a secondary claimant online. You must use Form SPCC1 (pdf) . If the primary claimant has given up their claim, you can claim SPCCC as a secondary claimant by completing Form SPCC2 (pdf) . If you believe you qualify as the primary claimant but the credit has     been granted automatically to another person, you should complete Form     SPCC1 (pdf) and submit it to your Revenue office. You should also     include any relevant evidence in support of your claim that the child lives     with you for the whole or greater part of the year. The decision on who is     the primary claimant will be made on the facts in the case. If there is a     dispute you can appeal Revenue's determination to the Appeal   Commissioners.

There are a number of legal approaches for married couples who wish to separate and the Revenue Commissioners recognise that a couple may separate without any formal arrangements.

You can read more about tax matters in the case of separation, divorce and civil annulment on Revenue's website.",918
702,"How a couple are taxed in the year in which they separate will depend on how they were taxed as a married couple. They may have been taxed under single assessment, separate assessment or joint assessment. For more information on these options, read about taxation of married people and civil partners . If a couple are assessed as single persons , there will     be no change in their tax assessment if they subsequently separate. If a couple are taxed under separate assessment , their     income up to the date of separation is assessed in the usual way and they     can transfer between them any unused tax credits and rate bands that     apply. For the remainder of the tax year after separation each spouse will     be treated as a single person and the single person’s tax     credit will apply to their income. Under joint assessment , one spouse is accountable for     tax purposes, the assessable spouse. If you are the assessable spouse, you are entitled to the married person’s tax credit and double rate bands for the full year in which you separate. You are taxed on your own income for the full year as well as your spouse’s income for the year up until the date of separation. If you are the spouse who was not assessable, then you will be taxed on your own income from the date of separation. You will be entitled to the full single person’s tax credit and taxed under the single rate bands.

703,"Depending on their circumstances, separated/divorced spouses may choose to be taxed either as a married couple or as single persons after the year in which they separate. The payment of maintenance and the type of maintenance payments are important in deciding which tax arrangement will apply. Maintenance payments Where one spouse provides payments for the support of the other spouse and/or children, these are known as maintenance payments . Maintenance payments may be made under informal voluntary agreements or they may be legally enforceable. Voluntary maintenance payments Voluntary maintenance payments are ignored for tax purposes: the spouse who makes the payment is not entitled to a tax deduction for it and the spouse receiving the payment is not taxed on it. Both spouses are taxed as single people on their other income. If you are paying voluntary maintenance and it is your spouse’s main income, then you may claim the married persons tax credit, rather than the single person’s credit, but you will still have the tax rate band for a single person. Legally enforceable maintenance payments Legally enforceable maintenance payments include those made under a court order or ruling, a deed of separation , a covenant or a trust. If the maintenance payment is for the benefit of a child then it is ignored for tax purposes. The spouse who makes the payment is not entitled to a tax deduction for it and the spouse receiving the payment is not taxed on it. A maintenance payment for the benefit of a separated spouse is taxable for the receiving spouse. The paying spouse does not pay tax on it; it may be deducted from their taxable income. Both spouses in this case are taxed as single people. Separated spouses may choose instead to be taxed as a married couple if there are legally enforceable maintenance payments. In this case the payments are ignored for tax purposes; the spouse who makes the payment is not entitled to a tax deduction for it and the spouse receiving the payment is not taxed on it. If they wish to be taxed as a married couple they must both confirm this in writing before the end of the tax year. To be eligible they must both be resident in the State and there must be a legally enforceable agreement for maintenance payments. If they are divorced, they must not have remarried. The way that maintenance payments are assigned either for the benefit of the spouse or children effects the way that the payment is taxed. This may make a difference to the amount of money actually received so it may be important to seek tax advice before maintenance payments are agreed. Divorce If you are divorced, your tax situation is the same as in the case of separation.

736,"Nearly all income is liable to tax. Tax on income that you earn from employment is deducted from your wages by your employer on behalf of Revenue. This is known as Pay As You Earn (PAYE). The amount of tax that you have to pay depends on the amount of the income that you earn and on your personal circumstances. There are a range of income tax reliefs available that can reduce the amount of tax that you have to pay. The Universal Social Charge (USC) is a tax on your income. It is charged on your gross income before any pension contributions or PRSI . You cannot use tax credits or tax relief (except for certain capital allowances) to reduce the amount you must pay. Find out more in our document on the Universal Social Charge . Income that is assessed for tax Under the PAYE system, income tax is charged on all wages, fees, perks, profits or pensions and most types of interest. Tax is payable on earnings of all kinds that result from your employment (including for example, bonuses, overtime, non-cash pay or 'benefit-in-kind' such as the use of company car, tips, Christmas boxes and so on). Money you get which is not liable to income tax may be liable to other taxes. If you get gifts or inheritances, you may have to pay Capital Acquisitions Tax . If you sell assets such as property or shares you may have to pay Capital Gains Tax .",1347
737,"Tax is charged as a percentage of your income. The percentage that you pay depends on the amount of your income. The first part of your income, up to a certain amount, is taxed at 20%. This is known as the standard rate of tax and the amount that it applies to is known as the standard rate tax band . The remainder of your income is taxed at the higher rate of tax , 40%. The amount that you can earn before you start to pay the higher rate of tax is known as your standard rate cut-off point . You can see examples of how to calculate income tax using these tax rates and the standard rate cut-off point.",606
738,"Example of standard rate cut-off point for a married couple or civil partners with two incomes In 2023, the standard rate cut-off point for a married couple or civil partners is €49,000. If both are working, this amount is increased by the lower of the following: €31,000 or The amount of the income of the spouse or civil partner with the smaller     income If one person is earning €50,000 and their spouse or civil partner is earning €33,000: The standard rate cut off point for the couple is €49,000 plus €31,000. The increase in the standard rate band is not transferable between spouses or civil partners, so the first spouse or civil partner's tax bands would be calculated as €49,000 @ 20% = €9,800 and €1,000 @ 40% = €400. The second spouse or civil partner's tax bands would be calculated as €31,000 @ 20% = €6,200 and €2,000 @ 40% = €800.",849
739,"Tax credits reduce the amount of tax that you have to pay. Tax credits are deducted after your tax has been calculated and so a tax credit has the same value to all taxpayers. After your tax is calculated, as a percentage of your income, the tax credit is deducted from this to reduce the amount of tax that you have to pay. So, a tax credit of €200, for example, will reduce your tax by that amount. You may be entitled to various tax credits depending on your personal circumstances. You can get more information about the different types of tax credits and reliefs and the tax reliefs available for people with disabilities . If you are entitled to tax credits that are not listed on the tax credit certificate that you get from Revenue, you should contact Revenue to inform them.",783
740,"Tax allowances reduce the amount of tax that you have to pay. The amount by which a tax allowance will reduce your tax depends on what your highest rate of tax is. This is because the allowance is subtracted from your income before it is taxed. In effect, it is ‘taken off the top’ of your income which can then be taxed at either the standard rate or the higher rate, depending on your income level. If, for example, you have a tax allowance of €200 and your highest rate of tax is 20%, then this means that the amount of your income that is taxed at this rate is reduced by €200 and so your tax is reduced by €40 (€200 x 20%). If you have the same tax allowance of €200 but the highest rate of tax that you pay is 40%, then the amount of your income that is taxed at 40% is reduced by €200 and so your tax reduction is €80 (€200 x 40%). This is known as tax allowance at the marginal rate . When your employer is taking allowances into account in calculating your income tax, this is done is by adjusting your standard rate cut-off point. Allowances at the marginal rate include: Tax     relief on employing a carer for an incapacitated person Tax relief on     pension contributions Guide     Dog Allowance Seafarer's     Allowance",1234
741,"Before calculating your income tax, subtract the following from your income: Pension contributions Payments to a Permanent Health Benefit Scheme (to a maximum of 10% of     income). This is a policy that will ensure continued income in the event of     an accident, injury or sickness. Tax allowances Work     expenses that were necessary to carry out your work duties Your taxable pay is then taxed at 20% of income below the standard rate cut-off point. The amount in excess of the cut-off point is taxed at 40%. This gives your Gross Tax. The value of your tax credits is then subtracted from this to give the amount of tax that you have to pay. Factors affecting the standard rate cut off point The standard rate cut off point may vary according to your personal circumstances. You may be entitled to tax allowances that will raise your standard rate cut off point. Alternatively, your standard rate cut-off point could be lowered. This could arise, for example, if most of your income is from your employer but you also have income outside this from which tax has not been deducted. Tax allowances have the effect of: Increasing tax credits by the amount of the relief at the standard rate     of tax. This grants relief at the standard rate of tax. and Increasing the standard rate band by the amount of the relief. This adds     the difference between relief at the higher rate of tax and the standard     rate of tax. This ensures that relief is obtained in full at the higher rate of tax if applicable. For example, a tax allowance of €1,000 would have a value of €200 to a taxpayer on the standard rate and a value of €400 to a taxpayer on the higher rate. The way this is calculated is to increase tax credits by €200 (1,000 x 20% standard rate of tax). This is the amount of the benefit to a standard rate taxpayer, but the tax allowance would have a higher value for a taxpayer paying tax at the higher rate. This is achieved by increasing the standard rate cut-off point by €1,000. This means that for a higher rate taxpayer, €1,000 that would be taxed at a rate of 40% is instead taxed at 20%, a saving of €200 (€400 – 200 ) in addition to the €200 saved by the increase in tax credits. The increase in the standard rate cut-off point would not affect a taxpayer already paying tax only at the standard rate, so he/she would only benefit from the increased tax credits. Benefits in kind and non-PAYE income have the opposite effect: Decreasing tax credits by the amount of the income at the standard rate     of tax and Decreasing the standard rate cut-off point by the amount of the   income This has the opposite effect to the example above. In this case, €1,000 would decrease the tax credits by €200, affecting both standard and higher rate taxpayers. It would also decrease the standard rate cut-off point by €1,000 having the effect of increasing the tax liability for higher rate taxpayers only. Marriage or civil partnership If you are married or in a civil partnership , this may affect your tax bands and tax reliefs.

742,"Your credit certificate shows the rate of tax that applies to your income and the tax credits you are entitled to. You can view, print or download your tax credit certificate through Revenue’s myAccount service online . At the start of the tax year, Revenue will automatically issue you a new tax credit certificate. Employers are given a Revenue Payroll Notification (RPN) , so they can deduct the correct amount of tax. If your circumstances change during the year, Revenue will update your tax credit certificate and RPN. Your tax credit certificate and RPN instructs your employer whether to calculate the tax you owe using: Cumulative basis Week 1 basis Temporary basis or emergency tax Cumulative basis Most people are taxed on a cumulative basis which makes sure your tax and USC liability is spread out evenly over the year. Under the cumulative basis, your tax liability is calculated based on your total income from the start of the tax year. The tax which must be deducted each time you are paid (the pay period ) is the cumulative tax due from 1 January to that date, reduced by the amount of tax already deducted in other pay periods. If a tax credit or standard rate cut off point (or both) are not used in full in a pay period, the unused amount can be carried forward and used in the next pay period within that tax year. Week 1 basis In certain cases Revenue may tell the employer to deduct tax on a week 1 (people paid weekly) or month 1 basis (people paid monthly) - sometimes called the ‘non-cumulative basis’. It means that the pay for each period is dealt with on its own, separate from previous weeks or months. Your employer will deduct income tax from your pay on a week-to-week basis. Your yearly tax credits and cut off points are not backdated to 1 January and do not accumulate for each pay period. This means you could be overpaying tax . Temporary basis You may be taxed on a temporary basis called emergency tax if you are changing job or starting work for the first time.

760,"You can get a refund of tax you have already paid if you: Were employed and become unemployed Are out of work due to illness Are still employed but have paid more tax than was due This page explains how to get a tax refund in these situations. Why would I get a tax refund? There are a number of reasons why you may have to pay less tax than expected and are due a refund. Your tax liability may be reduced because you are on unpaid sick leave or have become unemployed. For PAYE workers, your tax liability is spread out evenly over the year. To do this, your tax liability is normally calculated on a cumulative basis. This means that the value of your tax credits and standard rate cut-off point that is not used in a pay period is carried forward to the next pay period within that tax year. When an employer calculates your tax liability, they actually calculate the total tax due from 1 January to the date which your most recent wages are paid. This means if your income is reduced, for example, by sickness or unemployment, you will have unused tax credits and may be due a tax refund. You may also get a refund if your tax liability has been incorrectly calculated by your employer and you have overpaid tax. A tax refund may also be paid if you have bought goods or services for which you can claim tax relief. For some services and products, you can get some of the costs refunded from the tax you have already paid to Revenue, for example, tax relief for employing a carer and tax relief for third level education fees . The amount of relief you get depends on the amount of tax you have paid.",1605
761,"If you are unemployed or out of work sick If tax has been deducted from your pay since 1 January last and you are now unemployed, you may be entitled to a tax refund. If you have not paid any tax, you will not be due a refund. To decide if you are eligible for a refund, your wages are added to the taxable amount of the payments you are getting. Taxable payments include: Jobseeker’s Benefit (the first €13 per week is not taxable) Illness Benefit Payments under the Occupational Injury Benefit Scheme (including Injury     Benefit, Disablement Benefit and Incapacity Supplement) Any Increase for a Qualified Child that is paid with Illness Benefit or with a payment under the OIB scheme is not taxable. If you are employed and think you may have overpaid tax Find out more about tax overpayments and how you can claim a refund.",829
762,"Unemployed or out of work sick The amount of tax refund depends on: The length of time you have been unemployed The amount of tax you have paid The amount of tax credits you have used The amount of your weekly social welfare payment How your tax refund is paid If you are unemployed and due a tax refund, Revenue will refund you by cheque or to your bank account. If you are out of work sick, when you return to work your employer usually refunds your tax in your first week's wages.",483
763,"Unemployed You should apply 4 weeks from the date you become unemployed, however, if emergency tax was being deducted by your former employer you should apply immediately. if you are getting another income which is taxable, you should apply within 8 weeks of the date you became unemployed.

If you do not have myAccount online with Revenue, you can complete form P50 (pdf) and send it to Revenue . Unpaid sick leave When you return to work from unpaid sick leave, you should notify your tax office of the amount of Illness Benefit paid during your illness.

Generally, there are two types of benefits you can get from your employer in addition to your salary: Benefits-in-kind. These are benefits that cannot be converted into cash     but have a cash value. They are usually something that an employee has the     use of without owning it. Examples include loans at a special rate or the     use of a company car or accommodation. Money or other benefits that can be turned into money. Examples include     tickets to events, vouchers or having your bills paid by your employer.",602
766,"Most benefits are added to your pay and taxed in the same way. Your employer deducts income tax, Universal Social Charge (USC) and Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) on the value of the benefit. The rules applying to benefits-in-kind vary. Generally, the value of the benefit is the higher of: The cost to the employer The market value of the benefit If the employee contributes an amount towards the benefit, the taxable value of the benefit is reduced by that amount. Special rules apply to the following benefits-in-kind: Use     of a car Use     of a van Use     of other assets Preferential     loans Accommodation",620
767,"Benefits are usually not taxable if you earn less than €1,905 from your employer in the tax year . This exemption does not apply to company directors.

From 1 January 2022, you can get up to 2 benefits each year, up to a total value of €1,000. If more benefits are given in a year, only the first 2 benefits qualify. The vouchers or benefits can only be used to purchase goods or services. They cannot be exchanged for cash.",976
768,"If you get married, both you and your spouse continue to be treated as single people for tax purposes in that year. If, however, the tax you pay as two single people is greater than the tax that would be payable if you were taxed as a married couple, you can claim the difference as a tax refund. Refunds are only due from the date of marriage and will be calculated after the following 31 December. So, for example, if you get married in 2023, any tax refund due to you will be calculated after 31 December 2023. Refunds are normally only due where a couple are taxed at different rates and one spouse could benefit from the unused standard rate cut-off point or for some of the unused tax credits of the other spouse. When you get married it is important to inform Revenue of the date of your marriage. You can update your marital status with Revenue online .",861
769,"Civil partners are entitled to the same rights as married couples in financial matters such as tax, inheritance, property, pensions and maintenance if the relationship breaks down. Some legal relationships between same sex couples that are recognised by a foreign state (such as marriage, civil union, civil partnership) are recognised by Revenue for taxation purposes. You can read further information about civil partnerships .",429
770,"For the years following your marriage or civil partnership, there are three options for taxation: Assessment as a single person (you are both still taxed as single   people) Separate assessment Joint assessment",210
771,"Under assessment as a single person, also known as separate treatment, each spouse or civil partner is treated as a single person for tax reasons. With this option: Both spouses or civil partners are taxed on their own income Both spouses or civil partners get tax credits and the same standard rate     cut-off point due to a single person Both spouses or civil partners pay their own tax Both spouses or civil partners complete their own return of income form     and claim their own tax credits. One spouse or civil partner cannot claim     relief for payments made by the other. There is no right to transfer tax     credits or standard rate cut-off point to each other. You can request separate treatment in myAccount or by writing to Revenue. Either spouse or civil partner can make the claim and the option remains until the person who claims it changes their mind. If you want to claim assessment as a single person, you must apply within the tax year (preferably at the start of the year). Choosing to be assessed as a single person when you are married or in a civil partnership is unfavourable in some circumstances. This is mainly because you cannot transfer any unused tax credits or standard rate cut-off point. You cannot claim Home Carer's Tax Credit if your spouse or civil partner is caring for a dependent person and would otherwise qualify for the relief.",1375
772,"Under the separate assessment option, the tax affairs of spouses or civil partners are independent of each other. The difference between separate assessment and assessment as a single person is that some tax credits are divided equally between you under the separate assessment option. These tax credits are: Married or Civil Partner's Tax Credit Age Tax Credit Blind     Person's Tax Credit Incapacitated     Child Tax Credit . The Employee Tax Credit (formerly known as the PAYE tax credit) and expenses (if any), are allocated to the appropriate spouse/civil partner. Any tax credits other than the Employee Tax Credit and employment expenses that are unused by one partner can be claimed by the other spouse or civil partner. The tax credits are not usually adjusted until after the end of the tax year. Any tax credits that are unused (other than the Employee Tax Credit and employment expenses) and the standard rate cut-off point up to €49,000 in 2023 (€45,800 in 2022) can be transferred to the other spouse or civil partner but only at the end of the tax year. The increase in the standard rate tax band of up to €31,000 in 2023 (€27,800 in 2022) is not transferable between partners. If you think you have unused tax credits or standard rate cut-off point, contact Revenue for a review after the end of the tax year. Overall, the amount of the tax that is payable under this option (separate assessment) is the same that is payable under the joint assessment option discussed below. The claim for separate assessment must be made between 1 October of the previous year and 31 March in the year you want separate assessment to apply. Either spouse or civil partner can request this form of assessment, although the other spouse or civil partner will have to confirm this request. Separate assessment will then continue until you request to change it. These requests can be made in myAccount or by writing to Revenue . Each spouse or civil partner can complete a separate return of their own income.",2007
773,"The joint assessment option is usually the most favourable basis of assessment for a married couple or civil partners. This option is automatically given by the tax office when you advise them of your marriage or civil partnership, but this does not prevent you from choosing any of the options examined earlier. Under this option, the tax credits and standard rate cut-off point can be allocated between spouses to suit their own circumstances. If only one spouse or civil partner has taxable income, all tax credits and the standard rate cut-off point will be given to the spouse or civil partner with the income. If both of you have taxable income, you can decide which of you is to be the assessable spouse or nominated civil partner. The assessable spouse or nominated civil partner is responsible for filing tax returns and paying any tax due. You can select the assessable person using myAccount or by writing to Revenue before 31 March in the year you want the selection to apply. They continue to be the assessable person unless you both decide to change that. If you do not make a selection, the person with the higher income is the assessable person. You then ask the tax office to allocate the tax credits and standard rate cut-off point between you in whatever way you want. (The Employee Tax Credit, employment expenses and the increase in standard rate cut-off point of €31,000 in 2023 are not transferable). You will both receive updated Tax Credit Certificates showing the allocation of your credits and rate band. If Revenue does not get a request from you to allocate your tax credits in any particular way, it will normally give all the tax credits (other than the other partner's Employee and expense tax credits) to the spouse or civil partner being assessed. The spouse or civil partner being assessed must complete the return of income for the couple and is charged for tax on the joint income of the couple. If one spouse or civil partner is self-employed, joint assessment can still apply. The flexibility this option brings can be convenient - especially if one of you pays tax under the PAYE system and the other pays tax under the self-assessment system. Under joint assessment, you let your circumstances determine if most of the tax should be paid under PAYE or in a lump sum on assessment. This is determined by the way in which the tax credits are allocated. If you choose to pay most of your tax under PAYE, your credits can be transferred to the self-employed person (but not employment expenses or the Employee Tax Credit). If a refund is due at the end of the year, it will be repaid to each person in proportion to the amount of tax each has paid.",2685
774,"The standard rate cut-off point for married couples/civil partners is €49,000 in 2023. This amount is taxed at 20% and the balance is taxed at 40%. Where both spouses/civil partners have income, this standard rate cut-off point can be increased by the lower of the following: €31,000 in 2023 or The amount of the income of the spouse/civil partner with the smaller     income. You cannot claim this increase as well as the Home Carer Tax Credit . If you are eligible for both, contact your Revenue office to help you decide which would be best for you. In 2022, the standard rate cut-off point for married couples/civil partners was €45,800, with a maximum increase of €27,800.",677

Use myAccount or send a letter to Revenue signed by both of you. You can also fill in an Assessable Spouse Election Form (pdf) or Nominated Civil Partner’s Election Form (pdf) and send it to Revenue by 31 March. Separate assessment: to be assessed separately from your spouse, you must contact Revenue between 1 October and 31 March.

If you pay and file your tax return online using the Revenue Online Service (ROS) , the deadline is usually slightly later. The extended deadline in 2023 is 15 November. For example, if your accounting year is from 1 January to 31 December each year, you pay Preliminary Tax for 2023 by 31 October 2023, based on an estimate of your liability for the full year. At the same time, you make a tax return for 2022 and pay any taxes outstanding for that year. You are entitled to the normal income tax credits and reliefs. For 2023, you can claim an Earned Income Tax Credit of €1,775 (in 2022 the amount was €1,700). However, if you also qualify for the Employee Tax Credit (formerly known as the PAYE tax credit), the combined value of these credits cannot be greater than the value of the Employee Tax Credit. You must keep proper records which include: All purchases and sales of goods and services and All amounts received and all amounts paid out You must keep supporting records (for example, invoices, bank and building society statements, cheque stubs and receipts).

Universal Social Charge, PRSI and VAT USC: You must pay the Universal Social Charge (USC) if your gross income is over €13,000 in a year. An extra charge of 3% applies to any self-employed income over €100,000. This means that self-employed people pay a total of 11% USC on any income over €100,000. The USC does not apply to social welfare or similar payments. You pay your USC with your preliminary tax payment. PRSI: Self-employed people pay Class S PRSI on their income. Value Added Tax (VAT) You must register for Value Added Tax (VAT) if your annual turnover is more than or is likely to be more than €75,000 for supply of goods or €37,500 for supply of service. As a trader you pay VAT on goods and services acquired for the business and charge VAT on goods and services supplied by the business. The difference between the VAT charged by you and the VAT you were charged must be paid to Revenue. If the amount of VAT paid by you exceeds the VAT charged by you, Revenue will repay the excess.

Once your income is over this limit, you pay the relevant rate of USC on all of your income. It is calculated on a weekly or monthly basis. It does not apply to social welfare or similar payments, and there are certain other exceptions: see 'Income exempt from the USC' below.",398
782,"Income liable for the USC The Universal Social Charge is tax you pay on gross income, including notional pay (notional pay is a non-cash benefit, such as benefit-in-kind), after any relief for certain capital allowances. The USC is payable on pension contributions. If your total income is €13,000 or less per year, you do not pay any USC. If it is more than €13,000 per year, you pay USC on your full income. For married couples or civil partners, each spouse or civil partner is treated individually by their employer or pension provider throughout the year. Liability for the USC depends on the date of the payment rather than on when the income was earned. Although you may not have to pay income tax based on your entitlement to tax credits or by use of losses or capital allowances, you may still have to pay the Universal Social Charge on your income. Some sources of income are exempt from income tax but are liable to the Universal Social Charge. These include income from: The occupation of certain woodlands Profits from stallion fees Stud greyhound services fees and farmland leasing Patent royalty income Earnings of certain     writers, artists and composers Income exempt from the USC You do not pay the USC if your total income for a year is €13,000 or less. (If your income is €60,000 or less, there is a reduced rate if you are aged 70 or over or a medical card holder.) All Department of Social Protection payments, including Maternity Benefit , Paternity Benefit and State pensions , are exempt from the Universal Social Charge. Similar payments, such as payments made as part of Community Employment schemes or the Back to Education Allowance , are exempt. Social welfare or similar payments made from abroad are exempt. Student grants and scholarships are also exempt. Income where DIRT (Deposit Interest Retention Tax) has already been paid is exempt from the USC. There are a number of other exemptions. These include: Certain salary sacrifice schemes, such as the TaxSaver     Commuter Ticket Scheme and the Cycle     to Work scheme Statutory     redundancy payments Foster     care payments Child     Benefit Rent     a Room Relief You can find more information about USC exemptions on revenue.ie . Redundancy payments Statutory redundancy payments are exempt from the charge. Statutory redundancy payments amount to 2 weeks’ pay per year of service plus a bonus week, subject to a maximum payment of €600 per week. In addition, redundancy payments above the statutory redundancy amount are exempt from the Universal Social Charge, up to certain limits. These limits are up to €10,160 plus €765 per complete year of service in excess of the statutory redundancy. This basic exemption can be further increased by up to €10,000 if the person is not a member of an occupational pension scheme. The Universal Social Charge is charged on liable income after the statutory exemptions above, and after any additional deduction for Standard Capital Superannuation Benefit (SCSB) . Maintenance payments How maintenance payments are treated for Universal Social Charge purposes depends on whether they are voluntary payments or legally enforceable payments. Voluntary maintenance payments (payments paid under an informal arrangement): The spouse making the payments does not receive exemption from the     Universal Social Charge on the portion of their income that they pay as     maintenance. The spouse who receives the payments is not subject to the Universal     Social Charge on the maintenance payments that they receive. Legally enforceable maintenance payments (payable under legal obligation): The spouse making the payments is entitled to receive an exemption from     the Universal Social Charge on the portion of their income on the     maintenance that they pay, either directly or indirectly, to their spouse.     There is no exemption for any portion of the maintenance payments paid     towards the maintenance of children. An employee wishing to claim Universal Social Charge exemption for     legally enforceable maintenance payments throughout the year may either     give the information required to their payroll office, or they can apply to     Revenue at the end of the year to claim any refund of Universal Social     Charge due. The spouse who receives the payments is subject to the Universal Social     Charge on the portion of the maintenance payments that they receive in     respect of themselves. Any portion of the maintenance payments paid towards     the maintenance of children is not subject to the Universal Social   Charge. In the case of a legally enforceable maintenance arrangement, where a separated couple has jointly elected to be treated as a married couple for income tax purposes, the spouse making the payments does not receive exemption from the Universal Social Charge on the portion of their income that they pay as maintenance. The spouse who receives the payments is not subject to the Universal Social Charge on the maintenance payments that they receive. Pension contributions An employer’s or pension provider’s contribution to an approved retirement benefit scheme is not liable to the Universal Social Charge, but an employee's contributions are. Since 1 January 2016, employer contributions to your Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) are no longer subject to USC. Up to 31 December 2015, these contributions were subject to USC. Pensions Occupational pensions are subject to the Universal Social Charge, but Department of Social Protection pensions or similar pensions from abroad are not. The USC is only payable on lump-sum pension payments on the portion over €500,000.",5657

You must hold a full medical card or a Health Amendment Act Card to qualify for the reduced rate. People who hold a GP visit card, a Drugs Payment Scheme Card, a European Health Insurance Card or a Long-term Illness Scheme Card do not qualify for the reduced rate. If a person reaches 70 years at any stage during the year, they will benefit from the maximum 2% rate for the whole year. If you hold Northern Ireland medical card, you are not treated as holding a full medical card and will not qualify for a reduced rate.

You do not pay the Universal Social Charge if your income for a year does not exceed €13,000. For example, a person who is earning €13,000 per year will not pay any Universal Social Charge, while a person who is earning €13,100 per year will pay 0.5% on €12,012 (which amounts to €60.06) and 2% on the remaining €1,088 which amounts to €21.76). This person will pay a total of €81.82 in the year. A person who has self-employed income of €112,000 per year, will pay the Universal Social Charge at a rate of: 0.5% on the first €12,012 = €60.06 2% on the next €10,908 = €218.16 4.5% on the next €47,124 = €2,120.58 8% on the next €29,956 = €2,396.48 11% on the next €12,000 = €1,320 In total this person will pay €6,115.28 in 2023.",2207

To make an appeal against a Revenue decision or assessment you must complete the Notice of Appeal form (pdf) . There are guidance notes to help you to complete the form. You can send the completed form to the Tax Appeals Commission by email or by post. Generally, you have 30 days from the date on the notice of assessment or decision letter from Revenue to make an appeal. However, in certain limited circumstances, the Commission may accept a late appeal. These circumstances are set out in the Rules of Procedure . If Revenue raises an objection to your appeal application, you will be told as soon as possible. You will also be given a chance to respond in writing to that objection. However, the Commission will make the final decision to accept your appeal application. What happens after an appeal is accepted? After your appeal has been accepted by the Commission, you may be asked to give more information about the appeal (a statement of case ) and supporting documentation. Any additional information either you or Revenue provide must be shared with the other party. The Commission may need to hold one or more case management conferences to help progress a case. An Appeal Commissioner will normally set a date and time for an initial conference following the receipt of the statement of case. You will be notified at least 14 days before the conference date. The Appeal Commissioner can make a decision on your appeal using the information you send in without a hearing. If so, they will notify you and Revenue in writing. This is likely to happen where your appeal is straightforward. If neither your or Revenue objects, the Appeal Commissioner will proceed. You can insist that a hearing takes place and you have 21 days to do this. Hearings The Appeal Commissioner may want to talk with you before making a decision. In this case a hearing of your appeal will take place. You will be asked to attend a hearing at least 14 days before the hearing date. All hearings are public by default. However you can request that a hearing (or part of a hearing) be held in private. If both parties agree, the Appeal Commissioner can make decisions based on written submissions (rather than a full hearing). However you can insist on a hearing if you want. How long will it take to make a decision? The Appeal Commissioner will decide your appeal as soon as possible after they adjudicate on that appeal. After a hearing, they will advise you and Revenue how long it is likely to take to decide on the appeal (where this is possible). Once the Appeal Commissioner makes its decision on the appeal you will be notified within 21 days. Whatever way your appeal is decided, you will receive a detailed written decision that explains why the Appeal Commissioner made the decision. The Commission publishes all decisions on its website but you will not be identified. If your appeal is unsuccessful Decisions of the Appeal Commissioners are final. You can appeal to the High Court where you think that the Appeal Commissioner made a mistake in their decision, but only on a point of law.",3259
