If childminding income exceeds this the total amount is taxable, as normal, under self-assessment. The €10,000 limit is being increased to €15,000.

These changes will be included in the 2007 Finance Bill.

          Administrative changes to help taxpayers claim reliefs
         </h3>
         <p>
          A number of changes in administrative procedures are being introduced which will make it easier for taxpayers to claim reliefs to which they are entitled. For 2007 all age-related tax credits will, where possible, be credited automatically to the taxpayer where a verified date of birth can be established through Revenue or Social Welfare records.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          A system will be implemented to credit tax relief on trade union subscriptions automatically, based on trade union membership lists. For 2008 it is planned to move, where possible, to automatic repayments in respect of non-reimbursed hospital expenses, prescribed drugs pharmacy costs and certain tuition fees to the extent that this is possible using information from appropriate third parties.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Tax relief due on medical insurance paid by employers that has been subject to benefit-in-kind taxation will be automatically included in the employee tax credit. Work will be progressed on applying similar procedures in due course to nursing home and other medical expenses that qualify for tax relief.

          There will be substantial support for on-farm investment to help meet the requirements of the Nitrates Directive, reflecting the important role that farmers play in protecting the environment.
