          By law private landlords, approved housing bodies and people who let
student-specific accommodation must follow certain rules before asking you to
leave your rented accommodation. They must also give you a minimum amount of
notice, depending on how long your tenancy has lasted.

          An eviction ban was in place from 30 October 2022 to 31 March 2023. You
could not be evicted during these months if you were renting, even if you had
been issued with a valid notice of termination.
         </p>
         <p>
          The eviction ban covered:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Approved housing bodies
          </li>
          <li>
           Cost rental tenancies
          </li>
          <li>
           Licences and tenancies in student accommodation
          </li>
          <li>
           Wider private rented sector
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          If your termination date fell between 30 October 2022 and 31 March 2023, the
termination date was postponed until the eviction ban ended. Your new
termination date depended on how long you had been renting and your initial
termination date, see below.

          There was an additional protection if you had been renting for less than 6
months. In these circumstances, if you got a notice of termination during the
eviction ban, the tenancy could not end before 18 June 2023 or the notice of
termination would be invalid.

           the
Government announced measures
          </a>
          to help people whose tenancies will end when
the winter eviction ban ended. The measures are aimed at tenants who are being
evicted because their private landlord is selling their rental property. Some
of these measures are already available, some began when the eviction ban ended
and others will need legislation to bring them into effect. There are measures
for both social housing tenants renting privately and private tenants.

          Social housing tenants renting from private landlords
         </h4>
         <p>
          If you are a social housing tenant and your private landlord wants to sell
the home you are renting, the local authority can buy the home and you can
continue to rent it from the local authority instead. This is known as the
Tenant in Situ Scheme. It is aimed at people who are getting the Housing
Assistance Payment (HAP) or are part of the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS)
and whose landlords are leaving the rental market. You should contact your
          <a href="https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/">

authority
          </a>

          Private tenants who want to buy their rented home
         </h4>
         <p>
          If you are renting and your landlord wants to sell your rental home, your
landlord will have to offer to sell it to you first. This is known as First
Right of Refusal. You will be able to use the
          <a href="/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-buying-a-home/affordable-housing/">

          to help with the cost of buying the home. These schemes
are being adapted so people in this situation can access them. The First Right
of Refusal measure is not available yet.

          If you can’t afford to buy your rental home, or you don’t want to buy
it, the
          <a href="https://www.housingagency.ie/">
           Housing Agency
          </a>
          can buy the
home and rent it to you. You can access this scheme if you are a private tenant
who has received a notice of termination and you are at risk of homelessness
because your landlord is selling. This is a temporary scheme known as the Cost
Rental Tenant in Situ Scheme.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Housing Agency will be your landlord and you will pay the same rent as
you paid your previous landlord. You should contact your

           local

          </a>
          about this scheme, which began on 1 April 2023. They will assess
what supports you qualify for and give your details to the Housing Agency, if
this scheme is suitable for you. It is intended that the scheme will transition
to a

          If your landlord wants you to leave your accommodation, they must serve you
with a written notice of termination - see 'Notice of termination' and 'Notice
periods' below.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you have a fixed-term tenancy, your landlord cannot end the tenancy
unless you are in breach of your obligations – read more on the

          .
         </p>
         <p>
          However, if you do not have a fixed-term tenancy, the landlord can ask you
to leave during the first 6 months without giving a reason. They must serve a
valid written notice of termination and give you a minimum 90-day notice
period.
         </p>
         <p>
          In the first 6 months, your landlord only needs to give you 7 days’ notice
if your behaviour is seriously anti-social or threatens the fabric of the
property. See 'Exceptions to required notice periods' below for more
information.
         </p>
         <p>
          After the first 6 months you get
          <a href="/en/housing/renting-a-home/types-of-tenancy/">
           security
of tenure rights
          </a>
          , even if you have a fixed-term tenancy (of 1 year, for
example). Security of tenure is your right to stay in rented accommodation for
a set amount of time.

         <h3>
          Security of tenure and terminating a tenancy
         </h3>
         <p>
          The amount of time you can stay in rented accommodation after the first 6
months of a tenancy depends on when your tenancy began.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           If your tenancy was created after 10 June 2022
          </strong>
          , you have a
tenancy of unlimited duration. This means if you have rented somewhere for 6
months, you have the right to stay in that accommodation indefinitely (no end
date), unless the landlord wants to terminate your tenancy for one of the
allowed reasons. See ‘What is a valid reason for ending a tenancy after the
first 6 months’ below.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           If your tenancy was created before 10 June 2022,
          </strong>
          you have
the right to stay in your rented accommodation for up to 6 years after you have
rented for 6 months. At the end of these 6 years, your landlord can end your
tenancy without giving a reason, as allowed under the old rules, see
‘Exceptions to the valid reasons for ending a tenancy’ below. But, if the
landlord does not end your tenancy at this stage, it automatically becomes a
tenancy of unlimited duration and has no end date.

          Generally, your landlord can only end a tenancy after the first 6 months in
the following circumstances:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           If you do not comply with the
           <a href="/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-obligations/">
            obligations of the
    tenancy
           </a>
           , for example, by not paying your rent on time
          </li>
          <li>
           If the property is no longer suited to your needs, for example, if it is
    too small
          </li>
          <li>
           If the landlord intends to sell the property within 9 months. However,
    this may not apply if the landlord plans to sell 10 or more dwellings in a
    development within a 6-month period – see ‘Restriction on terminating
    when selling multiple properties’ below
          </li>
          <li>
           If the landlord needs the property for their own use or for an immediate
    family member (this only applies to private landlords)
          </li>
          <li>
           If the landlord plans to change the use of the property (for example,
    convert it from residential use to office use)
          </li>
          <li>
           If the landlord intends to refurbish the property substantially

         <h3>
          Exceptions to the valid reasons for ending a tenancy
         </h3>
         <p>
          There are certain situations when these valid reasons for ending a tenancy
do not apply, see below.
         </p>
         <h4>
          Landlords’ right to end certain tenancies after 6 years
         </h4>
         <p>
          If your tenancy was created before 11 June 2022, your landlord can terminate
your tenancy for any reason when you have rented for 6 years. The landlord
must:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Serve a notice of termination before the end of the 6 years, and
          </li>
          <li>
           Give a notice period that expires on or after the end of the tenancy
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          If the tenancy is not ended after 6 years, a new tenancy will begin. This
new tenancy will be a tenancy of unlimited duration and the above exception
will no longer apply.
         </p>
         <p>
          By June 2028, all tenancies will be tenancies of unlimited duration and the
above exception will no longer apply. This is because all existing 6-year cycle
tenancies will have ended by then.
         </p>
         <h4>
          Exceptions to Part 4 rights
         </h4>
         <p>
          If you are renting a self-contained flat or apartment in your landlord’s
home, which was originally part of the main house, your landlord can choose to
opt out of the Part 4 provisions. If your landlord wants to take this option,
you must get notice of this in writing, before the start of the tenancy.
         </p>
         <p>
          Tenants of certain properties let by housing associations do not get Part 4
rights. For example, people living in transitional housing. Transitional
housing is temporary supported accommodation that helps people move from
homelessness to independent living in permanent accommodation.
         </p>
         <p>
          Part 4 rights do not apply to tenants in student-specific accommodation.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Additional rules when ending a tenancy for a valid reason
         </h3>
         <p>
          Additional rules apply if your landlord ends your tenancy for some of the
valid reasons, see below
         </p>
         <h4>
          Requirement to offer property back to the tenant
         </h4>
         <p>
          If your landlord ends your tenancy for one of the below reasons and the
property then becomes available to rent again, the landlord must offer the
property back to you within 12 months of the expiry of your notice period.
         </p>
         <p>
          They must do this if they ended your tenancy because they:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Planned to sell the property within 9 months
          </li>
          <li>
           Needed the property for their own use or for an immediate family
  member
          </li>
          <li>
           Planned to change the use of the property
          </li>
          <li>
           Planned to refurbish the property substantially
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Your landlord must make every reasonable effort to get your contact details,
so they can offer the property back to you. This includes contacting the RTB to
ask for them. The RTB may have your contact details to give to the landlord.
This is because the RTB must write to you when they get a copy of the
          <a href="/en/housing/renting-a-home/if-your-landlord-wants-you-to-leave#lab681">
           notice
of termination
          </a>
          from your landlord. In this letter the RTB asks for your
contact details and your consent to pass them to your landlord if the landlord
needs them in future to offer the property back to you. The RTB will only pass
your details to the landlord if you have given your consent for this.
         </p>
         <p>
          If the landlord asks the RTB for your contact details and you did not
respond to the RTB's initial letter, the RTB will try to contact you again.
They will ask for your details and your consent to pass these to your landlord.
You have 7 days to respond to this letter from the RTB.
         </p>
         <p>
          When your landlord contacts you to offer to re-let the property to you, you
have 7 days to accept or reject this offer.
         </p>
         <p>
          Previously it was the tenant’s responsibility to ensure that the landlord
had their contact details so the landlord could re-offer the property to them.
But, since 6 July 2022 this responsibility has moved to landlords, as set-out
in this new procedure brought in by the Providers of Building Works and
Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2022.
          <a href="https://www.rtb.ie/regulation-of-providers-of-building-works-and-miscellaneous-provisions-act-2022">
           The
RTB website has a step-by-step guide to this procedure

          .
         </p>
         <h4>
          <strong>
           Restriction on terminating tenancies when selling multiple
properties
          </strong>
         </h4>
         <p>
          A landlord cannot terminate a tenancy of more than 6 months if they intend
to sell 10 or more dwellings in a development within a 6-month period,
unless:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           They can show that the market value with a sitting tenant is over 20%
    below the market value with vacant possession, and
          </li>
          <li>
           That preventing them from terminating the tenancy would be unduly onerous
    on them or would cause them undue hardship
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          This provision is often called the ‘Tyrrelstown’ amendment and it is
provided for under
          <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/act/17/enacted/en/print#sec40">
           Section

       <html>
        <body>
         <p>
          If your landlord wants you to leave, they must serve you with a valid
written notice of termination. The notice can be posted to you, be given to you
in person or be left for you at your address. Emails and text messages do not
qualify as valid notices of termination. If it appears that you are not living
in the property, the landlord can affix the notice to the outside of the
property.
         </p>
         <p>
          Since, 6 July 2022, your landlord must also send a copy of the notice of
termination to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB). This must be done at the
same time as it is sent to you. It can be emailed to NoticeofTermination@rtb.ie
or posted to the RTB along with the
          <a href="https://www.rtb.ie/images/uploads/forms/RTBNoticeofTerminationReturnForm.pdf">
           RTB
Notice of Termination Return form
          </a>
          . If this is not done the notice of
termination is invalid. The RTB recommends that landlords use certified post
when posting the notice of termination to the tenant and the RTB, and that they
keep proof of this.
         </p>
         <p>
          When the RTB receives the notice of termination it will:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Write to you and your landlord about the RTB services and outline your
    rights and responsibilities under residential tenancies legislation
          </li>
          <li>
           Ask for your contact details in case the landlord needs them to offer the
    property back to you. This will only be done with your consent
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          This requirement is in place since 6 July 2022, when it was brought in under
the Regulation of Providers of Building Works and Miscellaneous Provisions Act
2022.

           The
law
          </a>
          sets out the requirements for a valid notice of termination. It
must:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Be in writing (an email is not sufficient)
          </li>
          <li>
           Be signed by the landlord (or an authorised agent)
          </li>

          <li>
           State the reason for termination, if a tenancy has lasted more than 6
    months or is a fixed-term tenancy. (This does not have to be included for
    tenancies in student-specific accommodation.)
          </li>

           State that any issue about the validity of the notice or the right of the
    landlord to serve it must be referred to the RTB within 90 days from the
    receipt of the notice. (This 90-day timeframe applies unless the tenant is
    in breach of their obligations.)
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          The landlord must give additional details in certain situations and, in some

          If the property is being sold
         </h3>
         <p>
          If the landlord intends to sell the property within 9 months of the
termination of your tenancy, the notice of termination must state that “The
reason for the termination of the tenancy is due to the fact that the landlord
intends to sell the dwelling, for full consideration, within 9 months after the
termination of the tenancy”. The landlord must enter into a contract for sale
within 9 months of the termination date. The notice must also include a
statutory declaration stating the landlord’s intention to sell.

         <p>
          If the landlord is terminating a tenancy of more than 6 months based on the
‘Tyrrelstown’ amendment (see above), the statutory declaration must also
state that:

         <ul>
          <li>
           The market value with a sitting tenant is over 20% below the market value

           The property should be vacated while the works are being completed

          If the landlord wants to change the use of the property
         </h3>
         <p>
          If the landlord wants to change the use of the property the landlord must
include a statement setting out the nature of the change in writing, with the
notice of termination. The notice must confirm that any necessary planning
permission has been received. The RTB’s

information.
         </p>
         <p>
          If the landlord ends your tenancy because they are changing its use, and the
property then becomes available for rent again, the landlord must offer it back
to you. This must be done within 12 months of the expiry of the tenants notice
period.

          If you have a complaint about the reason your landlord gives for ending
your tenancy
         </h3>
         <p>
          You can complain to the RTB if your landlord ends a tenancy because they are
selling the property, changing its use, substantially refurbishing it, or
because they need it for themselves or an immediate family member and:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           The property becomes available for re-letting and they do not offer you a
    tenancy
          </li>
          <li>
           They did not carry out the intention stated in the notice of
  termination
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          If the RTB upholds your complaint, it may direct the landlord to pay you
damages or to reinstate your tenancy, or both.
         </p>

you must have received a written warning notice at least 28 days before the
notice of termination is issued – see ‘Notice periods’ below.

spaces and the size and composition of your household.

          about a
notice of termination, an adjudicator (or the Tenancy Tribunal) can overlook a
minor error or omission in a notice of termination. They can do this as long as
the error does not prejudice the notice of termination and the notice would
otherwise be valid. This is known as the ‘slip rule’ and it is set-out in

          These notice periods have applied since 6 July 2022, when changes under the

          Exceptions to required notice periods
         </h3>
         <h4>
          Not keeping your tenant obligations
         </h4>
         <p>
          If you are not keeping your obligations, your landlord must send you a
warning notice before they can issue a notice of termination. The warning
notice must outline what obligations have been broken and give you a reasonable
amount of time to fix the issue. This warning notice does not need to be copied
to the RTB. If you do not resolve the issue, the landlord only needs to give
you 28 days’ notice of termination. This applies to all tenancies, regardless
of the length of the tenancy.
         </p>
         <p>
          However, if your behaviour is seriously anti-social or threatens the fabric
of the property, the landlord only needs to give you 7 days’ notice and does
not have to give you a warning notice.
          <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/27/section/17/enacted/en/html#sec17">
           Section
17 (1) (a) and (b) of the 2004 Act
          </a>
          sets out the type of seriously
anti-social behaviour for which a 7-day notice may be allowed.
         </p>
         <h4>
          Rent arrears
         </h4>
         <p>
          Usually, if you haven’t paid your rent, your landlord must send you a
written rent arrears warning notice before they can issue a notice of
termination. The rent arrears warning notice must state the amount of rent you
owe and give you 28 days to pay it. The landlord must send a copy of the rent
arrears warning notice to the RTB. The 28 days you have to pay the rent arrears
counts from the date you and the RTB receive the warning notice. If the
landlord does not send the warning notice to you and the RTB, a notice of
termination will not be valid.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you do not pay the rent arrears in the 28 days, your landlord can then
give you 28 days’ notice of termination. The landlord must send the notice of
termination to the RTB on the same day it is sent to you. If this is not done
the notice of termination will be invalid.

          Can a landlord and tenant agree a shorter notice period?
         </h4>
         <p>
          You and your landlord can agree a shorter notice period than the minimum
periods set out above, but you can only do so when the landlord decides to
terminate the tenancy. It is illegal to agree a shorter notice period at the
start of the tenancy.
         </p>
         <p>
          You and your landlord can also agree a longer notice period, but the maximum is
70 days when the tenancy has lasted less than 6 months.

         <h3>
          What is illegal eviction?
         </h3>
         <p>
          An illegal eviction (or unlawful termination) is when your landlord stops
you accessing your rented property or removes your belongings whether or not a
valid notice of termination has been served.
         </p>
         <p>
          If your landlord locks you out or physically evicts you, you may be able to
apply for an injunction to force them to let you back into the property, or you
may apply to the
          <acronym title="Private Residential Tenancies Board ">
           RTB
          </acronym>
          to do so on your
behalf.
         </p>
         <p>
          If your landlord cuts off water, gas or electricity, you may be able to take
legal action to restore the supply. In either case, you should get legal advice
before you proceed. Your landlord cannot remove your possessions from your home
while your tenancy is still in existence (though after a tenancy has ended, a
landlord is under no legal obligation to store or look after you belongings).
         </p>
         <p>
          If your landlord is going to refer a dispute to the RTB, you should get
advice about your situation from
          <a href="https://www.threshold.ie/">
           Threshold
          </a>
          or a solicitor. The

         <h3>
          What is overholding?
         </h3>
         <p>
          Overholding is when you stay in your rented accommodation after the tenancy
termination date given on a valid notice of termination. Overholding is a
breach of your tenancy agreement and the landlord’s rights. It sometimes
happens when tenants can’t find somewhere else to rent when their tenancy
ends. The fact that you can’t find alternative accommodation doesn’t mean
that you have any right to remain in your rented accommodation.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you are overholding, you should keep up your tenant obligations, such as
paying the rent. Your landlord is not agreeing to continue the tenancy by
accepting the rent.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you are overholding, your landlord will probably
          <a href="/en/housing/renting-a-home/disputes-between-landlords-and-tenants/">
           refer the dispute to the
Residential Tenancies Board (RTB)
          </a>
          to get you to leave. The RTB will
adjudicate on the issue and may issue a determination order ordering you to
leave. If you stay in your rented accommodation after you get the RTB
determination order to leave, your landlord can go to District Court to get the
order enforced and have you evicted. If you go to court for overholding, you
may have to pay your landlord’s legal costs as well as your own.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you are
          <a href="/en/housing/renting-a-home/sharing-accommodation-with-your-landlord#la4956">
           renting
a room in your landlord’s home
          </a>
          you are not covered by residential
tenancies legislation so the process is different. Your landlord can go to
court to get an injunction to get you to leave, or they may change the
locks.
         </p>
         <p>
          Overholding can make it more difficult to find rented accommodation in the
future, as your landlord may not want to give you a reference. You can find
          <a href="https://www.rtb.ie/during-a-tenancy/overholding">
