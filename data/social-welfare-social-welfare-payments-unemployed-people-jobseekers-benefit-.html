        To get Jobseeker's Benefit you must be unemployed, or have lost at least one day's employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 days. You may continue to get Jobseeker's Benefit if you can only find part-time or casual work.

        Where a Jobseeker's Benefit recipient is working for part of a week, their entitlement will be based on a 5-day payment week. This means that for each day that a person is employed, 1/5th of the normal rate of Jobseeker's Benefit is deducted. If they get part-time work for 2 days, they will get 3/5ths of the normal Jobseeker's Benefit for that week and if they get part-time work for 3 days, they will get 2/5ths of the normal rate of Jobseeker’s Benefit for the week. You must still be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 to claim Jobseeker's Benefit.

        Re-qualifying for Jobseeker's Benefit
       </h3>
       <p data-block-key="dw7gc">
        You can re-qualify for JB if:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li data-block-key="qkf77">
         You have used up your full JB entitlement (either 9 or 6 months)
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p data-block-key="hpsm9">
        and
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li data-block-key="d4bq4">
         You have paid 13 PRSI contributions for at least 13 weeks (these contributions can be counted only after you have claimed at least 156 days (6 months) of JB)
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p data-block-key="6oadg">
        However, if you are working and claiming JB (systematic short-time workers and part-time workers) you cannot simply continue your JB claim when it is exhausted since you must have suffered a substantial loss of employment to re-qualify for JB, (unless you are a casual worker).
       </p>
       <p data-block-key="3nrjf">
        If you have lost your job you will have suffered a substantial loss of employment. If you are a part-time or systematic short-time worker, DSP will look at your pattern of employment over the last 13 weeks or another representative period to find out whether you have suffered a substantial loss of employment.
       </p>
       <p data-block-key="mxw41">
        For example, if you are getting JB and working 3 days each week as a systematic short-time worker or a part-time worker and your employment pattern has not changed during the course of your JB claim, you will not have suffered a substantial loss of employment and will not re-qualify for Jobseeker’s Benefit when you exhaust your claim. However, if your JB claim ends and your 3-day week working week is then reduced to a 2-day week, you will have suffered a substantial loss of employment and may re-qualify for Jobseeker’s Benefit.

       <p data-block-key="5zt9w">
        If you claim JB for a period, sign off and then claim JB again within 26 weeks, your claim may be
        <i>

        </i>
        to the earlier claim. This means that your claim is not treated as a new claim and:

         The cumulative total of days from the previous claim is continued (so, for example, if you have used up 100 days of your total JB entitlement of 234 days you have 134 days remaining on your claim)
        </li>
        <li data-block-key="j1nvj">
         The rate of JB is the same rate payable as on the previous claim, unless there has been a budgetary increase or change in family circumstances (such as a new child dependant).
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p data-block-key="68sgm">
        If your JB claim does not link to a previous claim it is treated as a new claim. You must wait for 3 days before getting a payment and your cumulative total of days starts from the first day of payment.

        You should apply for Jobseeker's Benefit the first day you become unemployed. Jobseeker's Benefit is not paid for the first 3 days you are unemployed (the first 3 days are any 3 days, not necessarily consecutive, in a period of 7 consecutive days).

        If you are unemployed for a second time within 26 weeks of your last JB payment, your application for Jobseeker's Benefit is not treated as a new claim and you do not have another 3 days of non-payment. See 'Linking claims' above.
