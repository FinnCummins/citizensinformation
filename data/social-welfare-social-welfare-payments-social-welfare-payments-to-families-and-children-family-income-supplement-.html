          Working Family Payment (WFP) is a weekly tax-free payment for employees with
children. It supports people who are on low pay. WFP used to be called Family
Income Supplement (FIS).
         </p>
         <p>
          You must be an employee to get WFP. You cannot get it if you are
self-employed only.
         </p>
         <p>
          You must have at least one child who normally lives with you or who you
support financially. Your child must be under 18 (or between 18 and 22 if they
are in full-time day education).
         </p>
         <p>
          To get WFP, your average weekly family income must be under a certain amount
for your family size. The WFP payment you get is 60% of the difference between
your average weekly family income and the WFP income limit for your family
size. For more information, see ‘Rate of Working Family Payment’ below.
         </p>
         <p>
          WFP is not taxed.
         </p>
         <p>
          WFP is not taken into account in the means test for a

          WFP is a tax-free weekly payment for employees who meet the following
conditions:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Work 38 or more hours per fortnight (in any combination of hours). You
    can combine your weekly hours with your spouse, civil partner or
    cohabitant's hours to meet this condition. You
           <strong>
            cannot
           </strong>
           use
    time spent in self-employment (or on Community Employment, Tús, JobBridge
    or the Rural Social Scheme) to meet this condition.
          </li>
          <li>
           Your job is likely to last at least 3 months
          </li>
          <li>
           You have at least one child who normally lives with you
          </li>
          <li>
           You earn less than the WFP income limit set for your family size
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          You must be employed, pay tax and PRSI in the Irish State. Under EU
regulations you may be able to claim WFP if your children are living abroad and
are dependent on you.
         </p>
         <p>
          WFP is paid for one year (52 weeks) as long as you meet the conditions. It
does not change if your earnings from work go up or down during that year.
After 52 weeks, you can apply again for WFP. Some changes to your situation can
affect your WFP – see below.
         </p>
         <h4>
          Apprenticeships and WFP
         </h4>
         <p>
          You can get the Working Family Payment if you are an
          <a href="/en/education/vocational-education-and-training/apprenticeships/">
           apprentice
          </a>
          as long as you meet the rules for getting WFP - see above. An apprenticeship
usually alternates between off-the-job training in an education centre and
on-the-job training at your employer's workplace. For the purposes of WFP,
apprentices are considered to be in the employment of their employer while in
both on-the-job and off-the-job training.

          <strong>
           If your pay from work is reduced
          </strong>

           If the number of hours you work each week falls
          </strong>
          to under 38
hours a fortnight, you are no longer entitled to WFP. You should tell the WFP
section of the Department of Social Protection (DSP) if this happens. See
‘Where to apply’ below.

          <strong>
           If you move to a new job

          you are entitled to be treated in the same way as when you are at
work. This means that you can claim WFP if you meet the conditions of the WFP
and already have a child. A pregnant woman who has no other children does not
qualify for WFP until the birth of the baby.
         </p>
         <p>
          You cannot continue to claim WFP if you take additional unpaid maternity
leave or adoptive leave, or if you lose your job after returning to work, or if
you give up your job.
         </p>
         <p>
          You can continue to get your WFP with your Adoptive Benefit, Maternity
Benefit, Paternity Benefit and Parent's Benefit as long as you meet the
qualifying criteria for both.

          <em>
           maintaining
          </em>
          means that the maintenance paid by you,
the WFP applicant, must be the main income of your ex-spouse, ex-civil partner
or ex-cohabitant. Your ex-spouse or ex-partner cannot have more than €100 a
week income in their own right and cannot be married, in a civil partnership or
cohabiting.
         </p>
         <p>
          WFP is awarded to you for 52 weeks. This means that an ex-partner who is
included in your WFP claim cannot get WFP in their own right, or be included in
another person’s WFP claim, during that 52-week period.

           Paying maintenance
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          If you are a separated parent and paying maintenance, you may qualify for
WFP. To qualify, you must be wholly maintaining the parent who the children are
living with. Because only one payment can be made for a family, the parent you
are paying maintenance to must not be getting WFP. You must provide written
evidence from this person to show that they are getting maintenance from
you.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you are paying maintenance for a second family because of a court order
or a legally binding agreement, the amount of that maintenance payment will not
be deducted from the income to be assessed for WFP.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Getting maintenance
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          Maintenance is assessed in the means test for WFP. This includes maintenance
for you and maintenance to you for any of your children. If you are getting
maintenance from more than one person, all the payments are added together and
the total is assessed as your means.
         </p>
         <p>
          Some of the maintenance payment that you spend on housing will not be
counted as income for the WFP means test. Your housing costs (your rent or
mortgage repayment) up to a maximum of €95.23 per week can be offset against
maintenance payments. Half the balance is then assessed as means. You must
provide proof of rent or mortgage payments.
         </p>
         <p>
          You can only use (
          <em>
           offset
          </em>
          ) your housing costs in this way for
maintenance payments if you have not already used them in a means test for
another social welfare payment.
         </p>
         <p>
          Non-cash benefits are not assessed as means. For example, if your rent or
mortgage payments are made by an ex-spouse or ex-partner under a maintenance
agreement it is not assessed.

          The DSP will assess your household income in a means test. It compares your
total income to the WFP income limit for your family size.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you earn less than the WFP income limit, you may get WFP.
         </p>
         <p>
          Your WFP will be 60% of the difference between the WFP income limit for your
family size and your assessable income. The combined income of a couple (who
are married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting) is taken into account when
calculating assessable income.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Assessable income
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          Income that is taken into account for the Working Family Payment is called
assessable income.
         </p>
         <p>
          The main items counted as income are:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Your assessable earnings and your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant's
    assessable earnings. (Assessable earnings are gross pay minus tax, employee
    PRSI, Universal Social Charge and superannuation (including the Public
    Service Pension Levy and contributions to Personal Retirement Savings
    Accounts.) Income from working as a home help is assessed.
          </li>
          <li>
           Extra income you or your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant have from
    employment (such as pay for overtime, bonuses, allowances or
  commission).
          </li>
          <li>
           Any income you or your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant have from
    self-employment.
          </li>
          <li>
           Income from occupational pensions
          </li>
          <li>
           Income you or your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant may have including
    social welfare payments and student grants.
          </li>
          <li>
           All family income from carer's payments (
           <a href="/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/carers/carers-allowance/">
            Carer's Allowance

           ).
          </li>
          <li>
           Rental income from the letting of property or land (the capital value is
    not assessed). The gross rental income is assessed and you cannot deduct
    mortgage payments or other expenses. Certain income from rent is not
    included in the means test – see ‘Income from rent’ below.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Generally, all financial compensation is taken into account. However,
certain types of compensation are not assessed as income. You can find a
          <a href="/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/cash-income-not-included-in-the-social-welfare-means-test/">

          as income.
         </p>
         <p>
          The WFP income test does not assess capital. This includes property you own,
bank accounts and cars.
         </p>
         <p>
          The following payments

           Calculating income for WFP
          </strong>
         </h3>
         <p>
          The Department of Social Protection (DSP) calculates your assessable
earnings over a certain period of time.
         </p>
         <p>
          Because WFP is paid over 52 weeks, the DSP tries to calculate your average
earnings over a similar period of time. Normally they will use your earnings up
to the date of your application. If you are newly in employment, your average
weekly income is calculated from when you started work with that employer.
         </p>
         <p>
          If your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is self-employed, his or her
income over the 12-month period before you apply is used to work out his or her
average weekly income.
         </p>
         <p>
          Again, to qualify, your average weekly family income must be below the WFP
income limit for your family size.
