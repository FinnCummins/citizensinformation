         <p>
          The State Pension (Contributory) is not means tested. You can have other
income and still get it.
         </p>
         <p>
          As the social insurance (PRSI) conditions are very complex, you should apply
for a State Pension (Contributory) if you have ever worked in Ireland and have
paid PRSI contributions (stamps) at any time.

         <h3>
          What is the new Total Contributions Approach (TCA)?
         </h3>
         <p>
          The new Total Contributions Approach (TCA) means that the total number of
PRSI contributions you paid, instead of when they were paid, are taken into
account when the DSP assesses your application for a pension.
         </p>
         <p>
          The TCA calculation includes the new
          <a href="/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/homecaring-periods-scheme/">
           HomeCaring
Periods Scheme
          </a>
          . The changes benefit people who spent time outside the paid
workplace, while raising a family or in a caring role.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you reached pension age on or after 1 September 2012, your pension rate
can be calculated in 2 ways: using the
          <em>
           average rule
          </em>
          or using the new
TCA – see ‘Rules’ below. The DSP will carry out both calculations and
choose whichever gives you the better rate of pension.
         </p>
         <p>
          The
          <a href="https://www.pensionsauthority.ie/en/trustees_registered_administrators/policy/national_pensions_framework/">
           National
Pensions Framework

          has proposed that the TCA be introduced to replace the
current
          <em>
           average rule
          </em>
          . However, legislation is required before any
changes may come into effect.

          To qualify for a State Pension (Contributory) you must be aged 66 or over

            yearly average
           </strong>
           number of PRSI
    contributions since you first started to pay PRSI (this is the average
    rule)
           <strong>

           </strong>
           have a certain

         <h3>
          1. Paid PRSI contributions before a certain age
         </h3>
         <p>
          To get a State Pension (Contributory), you must have started to pay PRSI
before the age of 56.
         </p>
         <p>
          The date you first started to pay PRSI is known as your date of
          <em>
           entry
into insurance
          </em>
          . Your date of entry into insurance is also important when
you calculate your yearly average number of PRSI contributions – see
‘Yearly average or total number of contributions’ below.
         </p>
         <h4>
          Entry into insurance
         </h4>
         <p>
          Your
          <em>
           entry into insurance
          </em>
          is taken as the date of the first paid
PRSI contribution made when you started your first job. However, this is not
always the case for people with mixed PRSI contributions or people who were
self-employed.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Mixed PRSI
          </strong>
          : There are special rules if you have mixture of
full-rate PRSI contributions and modified-rate contributions. Modified-rate
social insurance contributions are PRSI contributions at Classes B, C and D
(paid by civil and public servants).
         </p>
         <p>
          If you have mixed PRSI contributions and you paid your first full-rate
employment contribution before 6 April 1991 and before you were 56, your entry
into insurance can be the date you first started to pay the full rate of PRSI,
if that would be to your advantage.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you started to pay full-rate PRSI after 6 April 1991, your entry into
insurance is the date you first paid any social insurance.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Self-employed:
          </strong>
          There are special rules on entry into
insurance for self-employed people. PRSI for the self-employed was introduced
on 6 April 1988. If you started to pay self-employed PRSI on 6 April 1988 and
had previously paid employee PRSI at any time, then your date of entry into
insurance can be either 6 April 1988 or the date when you first paid employee
PRSI, whichever would give you a higher rate of pension.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you started to pay self-employed PRSI after 6 April 1988, your date of
entry into insurance will be the date your first full-rate contribution was
paid.
         </p>
         <h3>
          2. Number of paid contributions
         </h3>
         <p>
          The number of paid PRSI contributions you need for the State Pension
(Contributory) depends on your retirement date.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you reach pension age
          <strong>
           on or after

          <strong>
           6 April
2012
          </strong>
          , you need to have 520 full-rate PRSI contributions (10 years’
contributions). Only 260 of the 520 contributions can be

          This is probably the most complex aspect of qualifying for a State Pension
(Contributory). There is the
          <em>
           normal average rule
          </em>
          and the
          <em>
           alternative average rule
          </em>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Normal average rule
          </strong>
          : The normal average rule states that
you must have a yearly average of at least 10 qualifying contributions paid or
credited, from the year you first entered insurance to the end of the tax year
before you reach pension age. You need an average of 10 contributions a year to
get a minimum pension, and you need an average of 48 a year to get the maximum
pension. Your yearly average will be rounded to the nearest number. For
example, 9.4 is rounded down to 9 and 47.5 is rounded up to 48.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Alternative average rule
          </strong>
          : The rule says you must have an
average of 48 Class A, E, F, G, H, N or S contributions (paid or credited) for
each contribution year. This rule applies from the 1979-1980 tax year to the
end of the tax year before you reach pension age. This average of 48
contributions entitles you to the maximum pension. You cannot get a reduced
pension when this alternative average is used.
         </p>
         <p>
          The DSP looks at your average in two ways. It assesses both the normal
average and the alternative average. The alternative average will probably be
looked at first because it is easier to assess. Most employed or formerly
employed people will be able to meet the alternative average rule of 48
contributions.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you do not have an average of 48 contributions from 1979, then the DSP
will look at the normal method of assessing the average and you may get a
reduced pension. If you do not meet the alternative average, it is almost
impossible for you to have an average of 48 using the normal average rule.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Working in the home and the average rule
          </strong>
          : Since 6 April
1994, the
          <a href="/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/homemakers-scheme/">
           Homemakers’
Scheme
          </a>
          has allowed the DSP to disregard (or not take into account) up to 20
years spent as a homemaker when calculating the yearly average. The
Homemaker’s Scheme can only be used when calculating your yearly average
number of contributions.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Homemakers’ Scheme applies to anyone who provides full-time care for a
child under 12 or an ill person or a person with a disability aged 12 or over.
It applies equally to women and men. It does not apply to time spent caring
before the scheme started in 1994.
         </p>
         <p>
          It helps you most if you have worked outside the home for a number of years
and then spent a number of years as a carer.

Total Contributions Approach
          </a>
          (TCA).
         </p>
         <p>
          The TCA, also known as the
          <em>
           Aggregated Contributions Method
          </em>
          , does
not use a yearly average to calculate the rate of pension. Instead, the rate is
based on the total number of contributions you have paid before you reach the
age of 66.
         </p>
         <p>
          The TCA calculation includes the
          <a href="/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/homecaring-periods-scheme/">
           HomeCaring
Periods Scheme
          </a>
          which can allow for up to 20 years of homemaking and caring
duties. The Homecaring Periods Scheme can only be used with the TCA.
         </p>
         <p>
          Using the TCA, you will qualify for the maximum personal rate of State
Pension (Contributory) if you have 2,080 or more PRSI contributions (or 40
years’ of employment).
         </p>
         <p>
          If you have fewer than 2,080 contributions, you may still qualify for a high
rate of pension because up to 1,040
          <a href="/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/homecaring-periods-scheme#l1f4da">
           HomeCaring
Periods
          </a>
          (20 years) and up to 520 credited contributions (10 years) can be
used as part of your pension calculation.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           However, your combined HomeCaring Periods and credited contributions
cannot total more than 1,040 (20 years).
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          If your combined total of paid contributions, HomeCaring Period and credited
contributions is less than 2,080, you will qualify for a reduced rate of
pension. For example, a combined total of 1,040 paid contributions, made up of
HomeCaring Period and credited contributions, would entitle you to 50% of the
maximum pension (1,040 / 2,080 = 50%).

          <em>
           Pro-rata
          </em>
          pensions were introduced because some people were excluded
from the social insurance system at particular times. A pro-rata pension means
you get a proportion of a full pension.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Pro-rata pension for mixed insurance
         </h3>
         <p>
          You may get a pro-rata pension if you have a mixed insurance record. This
can happen when you spend part of your working life in the public service
(where you pay modified-rate social insurance contributions), and part in the
private sector (where you pay full-rate social insurance contributions).
         </p>
         <p>
          A career in both the public and private sectors may not give you a mixed
insurance record. This is because people with incomes above certain amounts did
not have to pay PRSI before 1 April 1974. In addition, certain groups (for
example, Gardaí) who now pay PRSI were outside the system.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you have mixed insurance, you may still have enough full-rate
contributions to get a State Pension (Contributory). However, it depends on
your exact circumstances. It is possible that one person will qualify but
another, who has more contributions, will not qualify.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you reach pension age on or after 6 April 2012 with a mixed insurance
record, you need to meet all these conditions:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           You have a minimum of 520 PRSI contributions (full-rate and
    modified-rate).
          </li>
          <li>
           You have at least 260 full-rate paid contributions since your entry into
    insurance.
          </li>
          <li>
           Adding together a mixture of full-rate contributions and modified-rate
    contributions, gives you a yearly average of 10 from the time you first
    entered insurance (or 1953, whichever is later) to the end of the tax year
    before you reach 66. This yearly average condition does not apply if the
    TCA (or Aggregated Contributions Method) is used.
          </li>
          <li>
           You do not qualify for a pension under EU regulations or under reciprocal
    arrangements with other countries (or you only qualify for a pension at a
    lower rate than this pro-rata pension would give you).
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          If you meet all these conditions, you may qualify for a pension
proportionate to the number of contributions that you paid at the full rate.
For example, if you worked for 40 years and 10 of those years were in the
private sector, you would get one-quarter of the full pension.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Pro-rata EU pension
         </h3>
         <p>
          If you have worked in Ireland and also in one or more EU states, your social
insurance contributions from each EU state will be added to your Irish PRSI
contributions to help you to qualify for a social welfare payment, such as a
State pension.

          Any increases in your State Pension (Contributory) for a qualified adult
dependant and pensioners over 80 years of age are calculated in the same way as
the personal rate of pension. Increases for a qualified child are payable from
one country only and, if from Ireland, are paid in full.

the rest of Canada). These agreements are broadly similar and they generally
let you combine social insurance paid in Ireland with the other country to help
you qualify for old-age pensions and retirement pensions.

in your payment for an adult dependant (called an increase for qualified adult
or an IQA)
          </a>
          . An adult dependant is your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant
(a partner living with you).

          Your income is
          <strong>

an IQA.
         </p>
         <p>
          Any income your adult dependant has from employment, self-employment,
savings, investments and capital (for example, any property except your own
home)
          <strong>
           is
          </strong>
          taken into account. If you have joint savings or
investments with your adult dependant, only half is taken into account.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you are getting a State Pension (Contributory), the IQA is automatically
paid directly to your adult dependant. This happens if the DSP get your
application after 26 September 2007.

         <p>
          However, you cannot get an IQC with your State Pension (Contributory) if
your partner has an income of over €400 a week. You get a half-rate IQC if
partner earns between €310 and €400 a week. This only applies to claims
made after 6 July 2012.

          Pro-rata pension for self-employed people
         </h3>
         <p>
          The self-employed have been obliged to pay sociAl insurance since 1988.
Prior to that, some self-employed people were voluntarily paying insurance.
Some self-employed people were already over the minimum age when they first
started to pay contributions in 1988. In April 1999, a special pro-rata pension
was introduced for them. Only people aged 56 or over on 6 April 1988 (born on
or before 6 April 1932) qualify for this pension.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Pro-rata pensions for people with pre-1953 contributions
         </h3>
         <p>
          There is a special pro-rata pension for people with pre-1953 contributions.
This pro-rata pension was introduced in May 2000. You may qualify if you have
at least 520 full contributions, some of which must have been paid before 1953.
Every 2 contributions paid before 1953 count as 3.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you meet these conditions, you may get a pro-rata pension of half the
normal maximum rate. The increases for a qualified adult and child are also
payable at half-rate. The increase for pensioners over 80 years of age is paid
in full.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Pro-rata pension for intermittent insurance
         </h3>
         <p>
          This pension no longer applies to new applicants from January 2013.
         </p>
         <p>
          The first group for whom pro-rata pensions were arranged were those who had
been in and out of insurance because of the operation of the income limit on
contributions. Prior to 1974, non-manual workers were obliged to pay social
insurance contributions only if their income was below a certain level. From 1
April 1974, there has been no income limit. Many people paid social insurance
for a period and then ceased to pay when their income went above the limit then
came back into the insurance system when the income limit was abolished in
April 1974. They would not meet the usual average requirement because they
ceased to pay for a while. On 14 October 1988, arrangements were made for them
to qualify for a pro-rata pension.
         </p>
         <p>
          Their average is measured in the usual way and if that average is 10 or more
they get a pension in the normal way. However, if it is between 5 and 9 they
may get a special partial pension which is one quarter of the maximum pension.
This pro-rata pension is payable to people who meet the quite specific
conditions outlined. That is, you must have a broken insurance record and have
re-entered insurance in 1974 because of the removal of the income limit. If you
re-entered insurance in that year for any other reason (for example, because
you had previously been self-employed or out of the country), you do not meet
these specific terms and you would not be eligible for this pro-rata
pension.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you qualify for this pro-rata pension you may also get the appropriate
Increase for Qualified Adult for a dependent spouse, civil partner or
cohabitant and an Increase for a Qualified Child.
         </p>
         <p>
          This pro-rata pension is for State Pension (Contributory) and
          <a href="/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/death-related-benefits/widows-contrib-pension/">
           Widow’s,
Widower’s or Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension
          </a>
          only. Because
it is easier to qualify for a Widow’s, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's
Contributory Pension, the numbers who need the pro-rata pensions are very
small.
