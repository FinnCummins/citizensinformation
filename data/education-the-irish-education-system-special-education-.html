         Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 (pdf)
        </a>
        - also known as the EPSEN Act - provides for the education of children aged under 18 years with special educational needs. The Act focuses on children’s education but there are references to further and adult education. You are a person with special educational needs if your capacity to participate in and benefit from education is restricted due to an enduring physical, sensory, mental health or learning disability. While the Act is passed, all parts of it are not fully in effect.
       </p>
       <p data-block-key="690lo">
        The Act:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li data-block-key="bd3kp">
         Provides that people with special educational needs are educated in an inclusive environment, as far as possible

         Establishes that people with special educational needs have the same right to avail of and benefit from education as children who do not have those needs

        The Act sets out a range of services to be provided to people with special educational needs. These include assessments, education plans and other support services. Parents can seek assessments of a child’s educational needs. Assessments can be initiated by the Health Service Executive (HSE), by a school principal or by the National Council for Special Education. The system for personal education plans is not yet in place and its implementation is being co-ordinated by the NCSE.
       </p>
       <p data-block-key="gt7a4">
        The HSE is currently responsible for providing health services to pre-school children and may provide speech and language therapy services. The NCSE will be responsible for providing services to school-going children.

        The Special Education Appeals Board and mediation
       </h3>
       <p data-block-key="p216a">
        The 2004 Act provides for alternative methods of dispute resolution and encourages a move away from the courts as the forum for redress. The Special Education Appeals Board was established in 2006 for the resolution of disputes and the determination of appeals and the first Board members were appointed.
        <a href="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/2011/05/04/00043.asp">

       <p data-block-key="r542h">
        When the Appeals Board comes into operation, the Act provides for the following:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li data-block-key="c16xf">
         If the council refuses to arrange an assessment of a child or to prepare an education plan, the parents of the child or the school principal may appeal to the Appeals Board.
        </li>
        <li data-block-key="3qc69">
         The Appeals Board will have the power to direct the council to arrange the preparation of an assessment or of an education plan. In this case, the council must comply with the direction of the Appeals Board.
        </li>
        <li data-block-key="cf7hi">
         The Appeals Board may dismiss the appeal of the parents or principal. The 2004 Act also provides for a process of mediation following the exhaustion of any rights of appeal under the legislation.

        Funding
       </h3>
       <p data-block-key="t0vpp">
        The 1998 Act gives the Minister for Education certain functions in respect of funding, including the funding of support services for students with disabilities.
       </p>
       <p data-block-key="nr9z0">
        Schools must use their available resources to ensure that the educational needs of all students, including those with disabilities, are identified and provided for.

        Boards of Management are required to use the State resources provided to the school to make reasonable provisions and accommodation for students with disabilities or other special education needs, including, where necessary, alteration of buildings and the provision of appropriate equipment.

       </p>
       <p data-block-key="vkhqx">
        There are certain specific provisions in the Acts in relation to education and some of these deal with people with disabilities or people who have special needs.

        The Equal Status Acts outlaw direct and indirect discrimination on a number of grounds including gender, religion, disability, race and membership of the Traveller community.

       </h3>
       <p data-block-key="4orm6">
        The Equal Status Acts set out certain activities that do not constitute discrimination. The following relate to discrimination on the grounds of disability:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li data-block-key="dev3o">
         Schools may make different arrangements for sport for children on the basis of age, gender or disability if these are reasonably necessary.
        </li>
        <li data-block-key="uywwb">
         Schools will not be considered to discriminate against a student with a disability if compliance with the provisions of the legislation would have a seriously detrimental effect on or make impossible the provision of services to other students.
        </li>
        <li data-block-key="ck2pm">
         In certain circumstances, discrimination on the grounds of disability can occur if there is a failure to do all that is reasonable to accommodate the needs of a person with a disability. If a person with a disability cannot avail of a service without the provision of special treatment or facilities then the service provider may be required to provide such special arrangements if there is only a nominal cost involved.
        </li>
        <li data-block-key="pzjts">
         The Act includes a provision that clarifies that the nominal cost issue does not prejudice or dilute the various provisions in the Education Act 1998 in relation to children with a disability. It should be noted that these provisions all relate to the use of public funds. This means that private primary schools are only obliged to make special provision for children with disabilities if there is only a nominal cost involved.
