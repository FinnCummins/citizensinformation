          This document is about the COVID-19 Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, which
closed on 31 August 2020. It was replaced by the
          <a href="/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-scheme/">
           Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme
(EWSS).
          </a>
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           This page can be used for reference purposes for information on the
operation of the TWSS up until it closed on 31 August 2020.
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          The Temporary COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme was announced on 24 March 2020.
It replaced the Revenue Employer COVID-19 Refund Scheme.
         </p>
         <p>
          It allowed employers to continue to pay their employees during COVID-19. It
aimed to keep employees registered with their employers, so that they could get
back to work quickly after the pandemic.
         </p>
         <p>
          The new EWSS commenced on 1 July 2020. The two schemes ran in parallel from
1 July until the TWSS closed on 31 August 2020.
         </p>

           The TWSS closed on 31 August 2020 and no new applications can be
accepted from that date.
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          The Scheme was available to employers from all sectors (except for the
public service and non-commercial semi-state sector) who had lost
          <strong>
           a
minimum of 25% of turnover because of the COVID-19 pandemic
          </strong>
          . Employers
had to make a declaration to Revenue confirming this.
         </p>
         <p>
          The scheme was available for employers who keep staff on their payroll
during the pandemic. Employees could be:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Temporarily not working (laid off) or
          </li>
          <li>
           On reduced hours and/or reduced pay
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          To qualify for the scheme, you must have:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Self-declared to Revenue that you experienced significant negative
    economic disruption due to COVID-19, with a minimum of 25% decline in
    turnover (between 14 March 2020 and 30 June 2020)
          </li>
          <li>
           Been unable to pay normal wages and normal outgoings fully
          </li>
          <li>
           Kept your employees on your payroll
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Employees must have been on your payroll on 29 February 2020, and you must
have made payroll submission on their behalf to Revenue in the period from 1
February 2020 to 31 March 2020.
         </p>
         <p>
          Employers could not operate the scheme for employees who were making a claim
for duplicate support from the DSP (such as the
          <a href="/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/unemployed-people/covid19-pandemic-unemployment-payment/">
           COVID-19
Pandemic Unemployment Payment
          </a>
          ). However
          <strong>
           if your employee was
already getting a payment from the DSP
          </strong>
          such as a carers or disability
payment, you could operate the scheme on their behalf.
         </p>
         <h3>
          People getting social welfare and other payments
         </h3>
         <p>
          People aged over 66 who were getting a State pension were eligible for the
Temporary COVID-19 Wage Subsidy scheme and could keep their pension payment.
         </p>
         <p>
          People getting a Working Family Payment were also eligible for the scheme,
provided all other eligibility criteria were met – see ‘Rates’ below.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you re-hired employees who were previously laid off, the employee could
qualify for the Subsidy scheme if their DSP claim had ceased. Revenue shared
data with DSP. The employer did not have to cease the employment for an
employee to be able to receive COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment. However,
if an employee was receiving both COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment and
the wage subsidy scheme, DSP ceased their COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment
payment.
         </p>
         <p>
          An employee who was receiving a TWSS payment and whose work was reduced to 3
days or less per week, could apply for
          <a href="https://www.gov.ie/en/service/c20e1b-short-time-work-support/" id="Short" name="Short">

          .
         </p>
         <p>
          The Temporary COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme applied both to employers that
top up employees’ wages and those that were not in a position to do so.

         <p>
          Apprentices who were not on their payroll in January or February 2020
because they were on an education and training programme run by SOLAS were
eligible for TWSS. The changes applied from 26 March 2020, the date of return
to employment or the date the employer was registered for the scheme, whichever
was the latest.

         <h3>
          People providing care

         <p>
          If you could not return to work due to personal circumstances, for example
if you needed to care for someone, your employer could keep you on the TWSS,
but was not obliged to.

         </h3>
         <p>
          From 4 May 2020, the subsidy payment moved to a system based on the previous
weekly average take home pay for each employee. The previous weekly average
take home pay was based on an employee’s pay in January and February 2020.
         </p>
         <p>
          On 4 May 2020 Revenue informed all eligible employers of the maximum
personal subsidy amount in respect of each individual employee on its payroll
based on the employee’s Average Revenue Net Weekly Pay.

           Subsidy is subject to ‘tapering’. That means the level of subsidy
        is calculated by reference to the amount of any additional (‘top
        up’) payments made by the employer and its effect on the weekly
        average take home pay.
           <p>
            Subsidy levels are as follows:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Flat rate subsidy of €350 per week, where the employer pays a
            top up payment
             <strong>
              up to 60% of the employee’s previous
            weekly take home pay
             </strong>
            </li>
            <li>
             Flat rate subsidy of €205 per week, where the employer pays a
            top up payment
             <strong>
              between 60% and 80% of the employee’s
            previous weekly take home pay
             </strong>
            </li>
            <li>
             No subsidy is payable, where the employer pays a top up payment
             <strong>
              above 80% of the employee’s previous weekly take home
            pay
             </strong>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Tapering is calculated by subtracting the gross 'top up' paid by the
        employer from the employee’s previous average take home pay.

            No subsidy applies for employee’s whose current pay is more than

          As normal business resumed and the employer’s contribution to the
employee’s pay increased, TWSS payments reduced through tapering – see
table above. When an employer payed normal pre-COVID wages, no subsidy was
due.

          Income tax and USC was not applied to the subsidy through the payroll. To
reduce the amount of tax that may arise at the end of the year, Revenue placed
all employees that received payments under the TWSS or PUP on a Week 1 basis.
Revenue issued Week 1 Revenue Payroll Notifications (RPNs) to employers.
Employers used the most recent RPN so employees were switched to the Week 1
basis as quickly as possible.
         </p>
         <p>
          When an end of the year review takes place, an employee’s unused tax
credits may be enough to cover any tax liability. Where this is not the case,
and they have underpaid tax, Revenue will normally collect the underpayment by
reducing the employee’s tax credits for a future year(s) in order to minimise
any hardship. If the employee has any additional tax credits to claim, for
example health expenses, this will also reduce any tax due.
         </p>
         <p>
          In many cases, the payment of the Temporary COVID-19 Wage Subsidy and any
additional income paid by the employer will result in the refund of income tax
or USC already paid by the employee. Any income tax and USC refunds that arise
as a result of the application of tax credits and rate bands can be repaid by
the employer and Revenue will also refund this amount to the employer.
         </p>
         <p>
          On 25 September 2020, Revenue provided more information on the
          <a href="https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/press-office/press-releases/2020/pr-250920-revenue-update-on-ewss-sweepback-payments.aspx">

          </a>
          . In January 2021, Revenue will make a
Preliminary End of Year Statement available to all employees. The statement
will give employees a preliminary calculation of their income tax and USC
position for 2020. It will tell you whether your tax position is balanced or if
you have underpaid or overpaid your tax for 2020. If you have an underpayment
of taxes, the following applies:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           You can arrange to fully or partially repay the tax due through the
    payments/repayments facility in myAccount, or
          </li>
          <li>
           Revenue will collect the underpayment by reducing your tax credits over
    the following 4 years, starting in January 2022. You will not have to pay
    interest on any underpayment.

          Employers paying employees’ 2020 income tax and USC liability
         </h3>
         <p>
          Revenue is facilitating employers who want to pay the 2020 income tax and
USC liabilities of their employees, where the liability arose from the TWSS.
         </p>
         <p>
          On a once-off, exceptional basis, an employer can make these payments,
without having to apply Benefit-in- Kind (BIK) rules. This is known as
          <em>
           concessional treatment
          </em>
          for BIK and TWSS debts.
         </p>
         <p>
          The concession applies to the liabilities of employees, self-assessed
employees and proprietary directors (subject to certain conditions).
         </p>
         <p>
          Employers have until
          <strong>
           end of September 2021
          </strong>
          to make the
payments on behalf of their employees.

          PRSI
         </h3>
         <p>
          Employee PRSI did not apply to the subsidy or to top-up payments by the
employer (employees are set to PRSI class J9).
         </p>
         <p>
          Employers PRSI did not apply to the subsidy and was reduced from 10.5% to
0.5% on the top-up payment within the thresholds set out by Revenue (see
‘Level of subsidy and income thresholds’ above). However, if the wage
subsidy plus any top-up payments exceeded the thresholds, the employee was
longer eligible for any subsidy and the employee returned to PRSI class A1.
