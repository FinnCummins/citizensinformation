          The main Budget changes which may affect people living in Ireland are set
out below.
         </p>
         <p>
          This document sets out changes in the areas of social welfare, tax, health,
transport, environment, housing, education, employment and other areas. It is
an overview and not a complete statement of the measures announced in Budget
2011.
          <strong>
           The document will be expanded and updated as information becomes
available
          </strong>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          Some of the changes announced in the Budget come into effect immediately.
Others take effect from the beginning of January 2011. Many others have to be
finalised before coming into effect. Some elements of these measures may change
when the Finance Bill is published – this is expected in early 2011.
         </p>
         <p>
          For a full list of the Budget changes, please read the Department of
Finance’s

         <h3>
          Rates of payment
         </h3>
         <h3>
          Older people
         </h3>
         <p>
          There will be no change in the rates of State pensions or other payments for
those aged over 66, for example, Living Alone Allowance, Household Benefits
Scheme and Fuel Allowance.
         </p>
         <h3>
          People of working age
         </h3>
         <p>
          The maximum personal rate of payment for all weekly schemes will be reduced
by €8 per week, except for personal rates for those aged 66 and over, and
Invalidity Pension and State Pension Transition recipients aged 65. Changes
will come into effect from the first week in January 2011.
         </p>
         <p>
          Associated maximum Increase for a Qualified Adult will generally decrease by
€5.30 per week from the first week in January 2011.
         </p>
         <p>
          Proportionate decreases will apply to both personal rates and Increase for a
Qualified Adult in respect of people on reduced social insurance rates of
payment.
         </p>
         <p>
          There will be a decrease of €8 per week in the maximum and minimum rate of
Maternity and Adoptive Benefits.
         </p>
         <p>
          There will be a reduction of €6 per week in the rate of Jobseeker’s
Allowance and Supplementary Welfare Allowance for those aged 22-24.
         </p>
         <p>
          The rate of payment of Jobseeker’s Allowance and Supplementary Welfare
Allowance for those aged 18-21 is unchanged.
         </p>
         <p>
          There will be a reduction of €10 in the personal weekly rate of
Supplementary Welfare Allowance.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Fuel Allowance
         </h3>
         <p>
          In response to the current severe weather, a once-off additional 2 weeks
payment will be paid to most recipients in the next few weeks, with the
remainder of recipients getting this payment in early January. This measure
will be worth €40 to recipients.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Children
         </h3>
         <p>
          Child Benefit will be reduced by €10 per month from January 2011 on both
the lower and higher rate with an additional €10 per month decrease for the
third child. Grants for multiple births (twins etc.) will not be reduced.
         </p>
         <p>
          Other child-related payments are unchanged: Qualified Child Increases,
Family Income Supplement, Back to School Footwear and Clothing Allowance,
Widowed Parent Grant and Domiciliary Care Allowance.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Carers
         </h3>
         <p>
          The rate of payment will be reduced by €8 for carers aged under 66. Carers
aged 66 or over will not be affected.
         </p>
         <p>
          There are no other changes to Carer’s schemes: the half-rate payment, the
additional payment for caring for more than one person and the Respite Care
Grant are retained.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Rent Supplement
         </h3>
         <p>
          The Rent Supplement Scheme will be reformed in order to control expenditure.
This will include an additional €2 per week contribution by certain welfare
recipients towards the cost of rent. This follows from the reduction in the
rate of Supplementary Welfare Allowance.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Treatment Benefits
         </h3>
         <p>
          The Treatment Benefit Scheme will continue to be limited in 2011 to the
Medical and Surgical Appliances scheme and the free examination elements of the
Dental and Optical Benefit schemes.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Other measures
         </h3>
         <p>
          There will be a reduction in expenditure on Departmental administration. A
range of other measures relating to control, eligibility and structural reform
will be announced at a later date.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Jobseeker's Allowance
         </h3>

taken tax free retirement lump sums of €200,000 or more since 7 December
2005, any further retirement lump sums paid to them on or after 1 January 2011
