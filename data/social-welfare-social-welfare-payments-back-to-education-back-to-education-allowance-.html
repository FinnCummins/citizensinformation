          If you are unemployed, parenting alone or have a disability and are getting
certain payments from the Department of Social Protection (DSP), you may take
part in a second-or third-level education course and get a Back to Education
Allowance (BTEA).
         </p>
         <p>
          If you want to do other types of courses not covered under the BTEA, for
example, personal development courses or general training courses, you may
return to education under
          <a href="/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/back-to-education/part-time-education-option/">

          .
         </p>
         <p>
          BTEA is only paid for approved courses that start in Ireland or in Northern
Ireland. However, you can be paid BTEA for a year abroad (for example, under
the Erasmus scheme) if the year is an integral or mandatory part of your
course. This must be verified by the registrar or admissions office of your
college.
         </p>

          Two study options are available under the BTEA scheme:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Second-level option
          </li>
          <li>
           Third-level option
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          All courses must lead to a
          <a href="/en/education/third-level-education/colleges-and-qualifications/fet-qualifications/">
           Quality
and Qualifications Ireland (QQI)
          </a>
          accreditation (these include FETAC or
HETAC awards) or equivalent. You must also progress in educational
qualifications. For example, if you already have a Level 6 qualification on the
National Framework of Qualifications, the course you attend must be for at
least a Level 7 qualification. This progression rule has been relaxed for
people applying for second-level courses at Levels 5 and 6 in certain limited
circumstances.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you already hold a Level 5 or 6 qualification in an area that is no
longer growing (obtained at least 3 years ago) and you have worked for at least
3 years and you satisfy all the other BTEA criteria, you may be allowed to do
further courses at either of these levels - provided the course is at second
level, will enable you to progress your career, lasts no more than 2 years (24
months) and meets future skills needs or local demand. Your DSP Case Officer
must also recommend the course if you are getting a jobseeker's payment.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Second-level option
         </h3>
         <p>
          You can attend a second-level course of education at any secondary,
community, comprehensive or vocational school. The course must be full-time and
lead to a certificate recognised by the Department of Education or approved by
Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), for example,
          <a href="/en/education/state-examinations/junior-certificate-programme/">
           Junior
Certificate
          </a>

           Post
Leaving Certificate
          </a>
          or a City and Guilds Certificate. An Access or
Foundation course is considered to be a second-level course for BTEA purposes.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Third-level option
         </h3>
         <p>
          You can attend any third-level course of education in an approved
third-level institution (university, institute of education or third-level
college). The course must be a full-time day course and be approved for the
Student Grant Scheme or be approved by Quality and Qualifications Ireland
(QQI). Note that not all QQI courses are approved for BTEA.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Undergraduate courses
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          In general you must be starting your third-level course at year one.
However, you may be eligible for BTEA if you:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Are exempt from part of your course because of a qualification you
    received in a previous course. For example, you have a higher certificate
    in a course that you now wish to take to degree level.
          </li>
          <li>
           Completed a year (or years) of your course as a part-time student
          </li>
          <li>
           Completed earlier years before becoming unemployed or receiving statutory
    redundancy
          </li>
          <li>
           Are permitted by your school or college to proceed to the next year of a
    course having dropped out or deferred a year (due to mitigating
    circumstances)
          </li>
          <li>
           Were getting a One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) while in full-time
    education and were affected by age-related changes to OFP. People in this
    situation may be admitted to BTEA mid-course.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Postgraduate courses
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          If you hold a Level 7 ordinary degree, you can apply for a one year add on
honours degree which may be in a different discipline. You cannot get BTEA for
a new Level 8 degree course.
         </p>
         <p>
          You may get the Back to Education Allowance for a postgraduate course of
study that leads to a Higher Diploma (H.Dip.) qualification in any discipline
or a Professional Masters in Education (post-primary teaching).
         </p>
         <p>
          Other types of postgraduate qualifications are generally not recognised for
BTEA. The only exception to this is where a college has admitted a person
without a third-level qualification to a Master’s course on the basis of
relevant life experience - in these cases the person

          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          You will not get BTEA if you already have a postgraduate qualification
unless it is a

           The
Student Grant Scheme
          </a>
          is divided into 2 components – maintenance grants
and fee grants. You cannot get the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) and the
maintenance component of a student grant together.
         </p>
         <p>
          Although you are not entitled to the maintenance component of the student
grant, you must still submit a student grant application form to be assessed
for a fee grant to pay your Student Contribution (formerly called the student
services charge), field trip costs and tuition fees (if payable).
         </p>
         <p>
          If you are getting a One-Parent Family Payment (or Jobseeker’s
Transitional payment) or a disability payment (Disability Allowance, Invalidity
Pension or Illness Benefit) you can choose to stay on your current social
welfare payment (if you continue to meet the rules of the scheme) and apply for
a student grant or you can choose to transfer to the BTEA, depending on which
option will benefit you most. In general, people who are studying full-time are
not entitled to Rent Supplement unless they are getting BTEA.

jobseeker's payment, Farm Assist, a One-Parent Family Payment or a Jobseeker's
Transitional payment, you must re-establish your entitlement to a primary

before 1 January 2015 can continue to get BTEA until the end of their course
and if they are progressing to a new approved course.

         <p>
          People getting BTEA who take up work during the academic year will be
assessed under the rules (including the means assessment) that apply to their
primary payment - that is the payment from which you qualified for BTEA. This
only applies since the 2016/2017 academic year to new applicants or people who
return to BTEA after a break. Before this, part-time work during the academic
year did not affect the rate of BTEA paid.

         <p>
          If you qualify for BTEA from a jobseeker’s payment, you can work any
number of days each week during the academic year. However, you must still meet

your BTEA is not paid over the summer months period between academic years. (It
will be paid from the start of the new academic year provided you continue to
satisfy the eligibility criteria.)

may also qualify for increases for a qualified adult and qualified children.
You must have established an entitlement to a qualifying payment immediately

contact you in March or April to ask the date of last attendance for the
current academic year and you will not be paid BTEA beyond this date. However,
you may get BTEA during the summer if you are on work placement or work
experience that is an essential part of your course.
