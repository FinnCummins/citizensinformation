          A Debt Settlement Arrangement (DSA) is one of
          <a href="/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/personal-insolvency-options/">
           3
debt resolution mechanisms
          </a>
          for people who cannot afford to pay their
personal debts. These mechanisms offer different solutions to people in
different situations.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Debt Settlement Arrangement applies to the agreed settlement of
unsecured debts, for example, personal loans, overdrafts, credit card or credit
union loans. The arrangement usually applies over a period of 5 years. The
limit of 5 years can increase to 6 years in some situations. When the DSA
concludes successfully, the debts that it covers will be fully discharged and
the debtor will be solvent again.
         </p>
         <p>
          This page describes how to qualify for a DSA and how the DSA process
works.

          Debt Settlement Arrangements provide for the agreed settlement of debts in
the case of people who have
          <em>
           unsecured
          </em>
          debts and have no prospect of
being able to pay off their debts in the next 5 years. You may opt for a DSA if
you have
          <em>
           secured
          </em>
          debts as well, but your secured debts will not be
covered by the DSA. See ‘Secured and unsecured debts’ below for an
explanation of these terms.
         </p>
         <p>
          You can only avail of a DSA once in your lifetime. You cannot get a DSA if
you are involved in one of the other debt resolution processes introduced by
the Act, or in the
          <a href="/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/what-is-bankruptcy/">
           bankruptcy
          </a>
          process.
Nor can you get a DSA if you have completed a
          <a href="/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/personal-insolvency-arrangements/">
           Personal Insolvency
Arrangement
          </a>
          or a bankruptcy within the last 5 years, or a
          <a href="/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/debt-relief-notices/">
           Debt Relief Notice
          </a>
          within the last 3
years.
         </p>
         <p>
          You can only get a DSA by agreement of a specified majority of your
unsecured creditors – see
          <a href="debt_settlement_arrangements.en.html#l2cc15">
           Main elements of a DSA
          </a>
          below.
         </p>
         <p>
          Before you make your application, you must either be domiciled in the State
or, within the year, have been living in the State or had a place of business
in the State.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Secured and unsecured debts
         </h3>
         <p>
          A Debt Settlement Arrangement only covers
          <em>
           unsecured
          </em>
          debts so it is
important to know whether your debts are secured or not.
         </p>
         <p>
          A
          <em>
           secured
          </em>
          debt is a loan on which property or goods are available
as security against non-payment. Mortgages and car loans are the most common
secured loans.
         </p>
         <p>
          Some examples of
          <em>
           unsecured
          </em>
          debts are: utility bill arrears (gas,
electricity etc.); credit card debt; bank overdrafts; credit union loans.
However, if they are rolled up into your mortgage, they become secured
loans.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Qualifying debts
         </h3>
         <p>
          As mentioned above, the only debts that a DSA can cover are
          <em>
           unsecured
          </em>
          debts. There is no limit on the total amount of debt that
can be covered. However, if your total debt is unsecured and is €35,000 or
less, you can opt for a Debt Relief Notice instead of a DSA.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you have some
          <em>
           secured
          </em>
          debts, you can apply for a Personal
Insolvency Arrangement, which can cover both secured and unsecured debts.
However, if you can manage to cover your secured debts, whether by making full
repayments or by agreeing an arrangement with your secured creditors (such as
interest-only repayments on your mortgage) you can apply for a Debt Settlement
Arrangement to cover your unsecured debts separately.
         </p>
         <p>
          At least three-quarters (75%) of your unsecured debts must have built up at
least 6 months before you apply for a DSA – in other words, you can’t apply
for a DSA if any more than 25% of your unsecured debts were incurred in the
last 6 months.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Excluded debts
         </h3>
         <p>
          The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 specifies certain types of debt that
          <strong>
           cannot
          </strong>
          be written off by the new debt settlement procedures,
which include the Debt Settlement Arrangement. These are called
          <em>
           excluded
          </em>
          debts.
         </p>
         <p>
          The types of debt that are
          <em>
           excluded
          </em>
          and cannot be covered by a DSA
are:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Debts under family law orders, such as
           <a href="/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/maintenance-orders-and-agreements/">
            maintenance
    orders
           </a>
           for spouses and children
          </li>
          <li>
           Debts due under court awards for personal injury or wrongful death
          </li>
          <li>
           Debts arising from a loan (or forbearance of a loan) obtained through
    fraud or similar wrongdoing
          </li>
          <li>
           Debts arising under fines imposed by the courts for criminal offences or
    court orders made under the Proceeds of Crime Acts
          </li>
         </ul>
         <h3>
          Excludable debts
         </h3>
         <p>
          The Act specifies certain other types of debt to be
          <em>
           excludable
          </em>
          from
a DSA. This means that they can be covered by the DSA if the creditor is asked
and agrees to let them be included – in which case they become
          <em>
           permitted
          </em>
          debts – debts that the creditor permits to be covered. If
the creditor is asked and does not respond, the creditor will also have been
deemed to have consented to the debts being included. Most types of excludable
debts are those owed to the State.
         </p>
         <p>
          The types of debt that are
          <em>
           excludable
          </em>
          and may be covered if the
creditor agrees are:
         </p>

          You must make your proposal for a Debt Settlement Arrangement through a
Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) – see
          <a href="debt_settlement_arrangements.en.html#l429e1">

         <p>
          The DSA proposal must be agreed by you and then approved at a creditors’
meeting. The proposed DSA will have to get the support of creditors
representing at least 65% of the total debt that it covers.

         <p>
          A DSA may involve you making regular payments of agreed amounts to your
Personal Insolvency Practitioner, who will distribute them to your creditors
according to the terms of the DSA.
         </p>
         <p>
          Your creditors may not take any action against you to enforce the debt
during the lifetime of the DSA. If you keep to the terms of the DSA, the rest
of your debt to the creditors that it covered will be discharged and you will
be solvent again.

           Cross-border recognition
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          The DSA has been designated as an insolvency proceeding which can benefit
from cross-border recognition. This means that a debtor availing of a DSA will
gain the same protection against creditors in most other EU countries that they
receive in Ireland, subject to and in accordance with the

         <h3>
          Mandatory terms of a DSA
         </h3>
         <p>
          There are certain elements that the DSA
          <strong>
           must
          </strong>
          contain:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           The maximum duration of the agreement must be 5 years but this may be
    extended by up to one year in circumstances as specified in the terms of
    the arrangement
          </li>
          <li>
           If you keep to the terms of the agreement your remaining debts to the
    creditors covered by the DSA will be discharged
          </li>
          <li>
           You remain liable for certain debts unless the proposed arrangement
    explicitly provides for a compromise agreement and the creditor has agreed
    in writing to accept this – see ‘Excluded debts’ and ‘Excludable
    debts’ above
          </li>
          <li>
           The DSA cannot release you from fines or other monetary penalties arising
    from criminal offences
          </li>
          <li>
           It cannot require you to sell any assets that are reasonably necessary
    for your employment or business unless you agree to such a sale
          </li>
          <li>
           You must be left with
           <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/RLE_calculated">
            enough income to
    maintain a reasonable standard of living
           </a>
           for yourself and your
    dependants
          </li>
          <li>
           It must not require you to dispose of your principal private residence
    (your home) or to cease to occupy it unless specific conditions are met
          </li>
          <li>
           It must outline how your debts will be treated in the event of your death
    or mental incapacity
          </li>
          <li>
           It must provide that your circumstances be reviewed by the Personal
    Insolvency Practitioner at regular intervals (not more than 12 months)
    during the currency of the DSA; this review will involve the preparation of
    a new Prescribed Financial Statement that must be sent to all the
  creditors.
          </li>
          <li>
           It must make provision for the Personal Insolvency Practitioner’s
  costs
          </li>
         </ul>
         <h3>
          Pension income
         </h3>
         <p>
          If you are entitled to receive pension income or a pension lump sum, it will
be treated as an income/asset for the purposes of a Debt Settlement
Arrangement. The terms of the DSA may provide for some or all of that pension
lump sum or income to be paid to your creditors while the DSA is in effect.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Pension fund
         </h3>
         <p>
          Your pension fund itself will be excluded from any DSA arrangement if it is
a
          <em>
           relevant pension arrangement
          </em>
          for the purposes of the Act. Approved
Retirement Funds (ARFs) are not
          <em>
           relevant pension arrangements
          </em>
          and may
be included in a DSA.
         </p>
         <p>
          You must be transparent in relation to all pension contributions that you
have made in the past. The PIP will review these and where the PIP or a
creditor considers that you have made excessive pension contributions within 3
years prior to application for a protective certificate, either of them can
apply to the court to recover these contributions for distribution to
creditors.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Credit
         </h3>
         <p>
          While the DSA is in effect, you may not get credit for any amount over
€650 without informing the lender that you have a DSA. You may not sell or
deal in property above a certain value, except in accordance with the terms of
the DSA. However, no such restriction is placed on your spouse or civil
partner.

          You must make your proposal for a DSA through a Personal Insolvency
Practitioner (PIP). This is a professional who is authorised by the
          <a href="https://www.isi.gov.ie/">
           Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI)
          </a>
          and will
act on your behalf throughout the Debt Settlement Arrangement.
         </p>
         <p>
          The ISI has developed a
          <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/Protocol_Team">
           standard protocol
          </a>
          for use by PIPs when making straightforward proposals to creditors for a
DSA.
         </p>
         <p>
          You must disclose all details of your financial affairs to the PIP, who will
then advise you whether or not you meet the conditions for a DSA, what the
consequences will be and what fees you may have to pay. The PIP will also
advise you of any other options that are available.
         </p>
         <p>
          The PIP will help you complete a
          <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/Prescribed_Financial_Statement">
           Prescribed
Financial Statement
          </a>
          as part of your application, giving full and honest
information about your financial circumstances.
         </p>
         <p>
          You must also make a declaration that you have been unable to agree an
alternative repayment arrangement with your creditor(s).
         </p>
         <p>
          You will have to give your written consent to enable:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           The PIP to disclose your personal data to the ISI
          </li>
          <li>
           The ISI to process your application
          </li>
          <li>
           The ISI to make any necessary enquiries about you and
          </li>
          <li>
           The ISI to disclose your personal data to the creditors concerned, as
    required
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          In general, you must act in good faith and co-operate fully with the
process.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Fees
         </h3>
         <p>
          The ISI has waived its fees for
          <a href="/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/personal-insolvency-options/">
           the 3 debt solutions
          </a>
          until 31
December 2023.
         </p>
         <p>
          There is no set scale of fees for PIPs, but they are required to specify
their charges and associated costs clearly before being appointed to act on
your behalf.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Protective certificate
         </h3>
         <p>
          The Personal Insolvency Practitioner sends your application to the
Insolvency Service. The ISI checks that all the details are in order and, if
so, issues a certificate to that effect and forwards all the documentation to
the relevant court (the Circuit Court in cases up to €2.5 million and the
High Court in larger cases). The court reviews the documentation and, if all is
in order, issues a protective certificate. The Insolvency Service records the
details of the protective certificate on its
          <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/EN/ISI/PAGES/REGISTER_OF_PCS">
           Register of
Protective Certificates
          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          The Personal Insolvency Practitioner then notifies each of your creditors of
the existence of the protective certificate and your intention to make a
proposal for a DSA.
         </p>
         <p>
          The protective certificate will give you an initial period of 70 days during
which your creditors may not:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Start or continue legal proceedings in respect of the debt
          </li>
          <li>
           Take or continue any steps to enforce a judgment or contact you about the
    debt unless you agree to this
          </li>
          <li>
           Start or continue bankruptcy proceedings against you
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          The court may extend the period of the protective certificate by up to 40
days if it is satisfied that:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           You and the Personal Insolvency Practitioner have acted in good faith and
    with reasonable expedition, and
          </li>
          <li>
           It is likely that, if the extension is granted, a proposal for a DSA will
    be made that is likely to be accepted by the creditors and successfully
    completed by you
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          The court may also extend the period of the protective certificate by up to
40 days, or by a further period up to 40 days, where there are exceptional
circumstances or other circumstances outside your or the PIP’s control.
         </p>
         <p>
          A creditor may apply to the court for an order directing that the protective
certificate not apply to him or her. The court will grant this order only if
satisfied that failing to give it would cause irreparable loss to the creditor
that would not otherwise occur and that no other creditor to whom notice of the
protective certificate has been given would be unfairly prejudiced.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Formulating a DSA proposal
         </h3>
         <p>
          Once the protective certificate has been granted, your PIP must invite the
relevant creditors to make proposals about the manner in which the debts might
be dealt with as part of a DSA. The creditors must be given your Prescribed
Financial Statement.
         </p>
         <p>
          In order to help the PIP to formulate the proposal, you will be required to
provide an honest and accurate account of your living expenses, your life plans
and any circumstances that may be relevant to how much of your debts you can
pay, now and in the future.
         </p>
         <p>
          When formulating the proposal for a DSA, the PIP will ensure, as far as is
reasonably practicable, that you are not required to sell or move out of your
principal private residence (your home). If you wish to move out, or if the PIP
believes that the running costs of staying in your home are disproportionately
large, the DSA may provide for you to move out of it.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Creditors’ meeting
         </h3>
         <p>
          When you have consented to the proposal for a DSA that has been formulated
by your PIP, the PIP must call a creditors’ meeting. If there is only one
creditor, he or she may write to the PIP indicating agreement or rejection. The
creditors vote on whether or not to accept the proposed arrangement. Each vote
is proportional to the amount of debt owed to that creditor. In order for the
arrangement to be accepted, creditors representing 65% or more of the value of
your total unsecured debt must vote in favour of the proposal.
         </p>
         <p>
          If the creditors reject the proposal, the protective certificate ceases to
have effect and the DSA process will have come to an end.
         </p>
         <p>
          If the proposal is accepted, the PIP must inform the Insolvency Service and
tell creditors of their right to object to the relevant court - (the Circuit
Court in cases up to €2.5 million and the High Court in larger cases). The
Insolvency Service notifies the court. If there is any objection, the
protective certificate remains in place until the matter is decided.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Objections by creditors
         </h3>
         <p>
          The grounds on which an objection to the coming into effect of the Debt
Settlement Arrangement may be made are limited and include the following:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           You arranged your affairs in the previous 2 years primarily with a view
    to becoming eligible for a Debt Settlement Arrangement or a Personal
    Insolvency Arrangement
          </li>
          <li>
           The procedural requirements were not followed
          </li>
          <li>
           A material inaccuracy or omission exists in your Prescribed Financial
    Statement that causes a material detriment to the creditor
          </li>
          <li>
           You did not meet the requirements when the arrangement was proposed
          </li>
          <li>
           The arrangement unfairly prejudices the interests of a creditor
          </li>
          <li>
           You have committed an offence under the personal insolvency
  legislation
          </li>
          <li>
           You have entered into a transaction at an undervalue or given a
    preference to a person in the previous three years that has materially
    contributed to your inability to pay your debts
          </li>
         </ul>
         <h3>
          Issuing a Debt Settlement Arrangement
         </h3>
         <p>
          If there is no objection or an objection is not upheld, the court approves
the Debt Settlement Arrangement if satisfied that all the conditions have been
met. The Insolvency Service records the DSA in its
          <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/EN/ISI/PAGES/REGISTER_DSA">
           Register of Debt
Settlement Arrangements
          </a>
          and it comes into effect.

         <h3>
          Deferring Local Property Tax
         </h3>
         <p>
          Once you have entered into a Debt Settlement Arrangement, you can apply for

          Varying or ending a Debt Settlement Arrangement
         </h3>
         <p>
          Debt Settlement Arrangements may be
          <strong>
           varied
          </strong>
          if there is a
material change in a debtor’s circumstances that would affect his/her ability
to make repayments under the DSA – the procedures are similar to those for
setting up the arrangement.
         </p>
         <p>
          A creditor or a PIP may apply to the court at any time during the Debt
Settlement Arrangement to have it
          <strong>
           ended
          </strong>
          . The grounds for such
an application will be limited and include the following:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Your Prescribed Financial Statement has a material inaccuracy or omission
    that causes a material detriment to the creditor
          </li>
          <li>
           You did not meet the eligibility criteria when you started the
  process
          </li>
          <li>
           You did not comply with the terms of the Debt Settlement Arrangement
          </li>
          <li>
           You have committed an offence under the personal insolvency legislation
    since the arrangement came into effect
          </li>
          <li>
           You are in arrears with your payments for a period of not less than 3
    months

          .
         </p>
         <p>
          If you are in arrears with your payments for more than 6 months, the DSA
will be deemed to have failed. This will be recorded in the Register of Debt
Settlement Arrangements.

         <h3>
          When a Debt Settlement Arrangement ends
         </h3>
         <p>
          If the arrangement ends other than by successful completion, you become
fully liable for all specified debts,
          <strong>
           including
          </strong>
          arrears,
charges and interest that have accrued during the DSA period,
          <strong>
           less
          </strong>
          any payments made by you during that time,
          <strong>
           unless
          </strong>
          the terms of the DSA specify, or the court has ordered,
otherwise.
         </p>
         <p>
          If the arrangement is successfully completed, you are discharged from the
debts covered by the DSA. The successful completion is recorded on the Register
of Debt Settlement Arrangements. You are now solvent.
