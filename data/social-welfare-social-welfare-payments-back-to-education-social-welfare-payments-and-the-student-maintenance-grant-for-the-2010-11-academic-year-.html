         <p>
          If you are returning to education and have been getting a social welfare
payment you may qualify for the Back to Education Allowance or the student
grant depending on your circumstances. You cannot get the Back to Education
Allowance (BTEA) and a full student grant at the same time.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you are getting One-Parent Family Payment (OFP), Jobseeker's Transitional
payment, Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension or Illness Benefit, you will
need to assess whether it is more beneficial for you to transfer to the BTEA
when you go back to education or to remain on your current payment and apply
for a student grant. If you are receiving Jobseeker’s Benefit or
Jobseeker’s Allowance, you must transfer to the BTEA if you wish to keep a
social welfare payment when you go back to education. People who have
transferred from OFP to the Jobseeker's Transitional payment can attend a
full-time course.
         </p>
         <p>
          Since 2015, if you are a new BTEA applicant and you were getting a
jobseeker’s payment, Farm Assist, a One-Parent Family Payment or a
Jobseeker's Transitional payment, you must re-establish your entitlement to a
primary payment to continue to be entitled to BTEA for the second or subsequent
years of study.

          <a href="/en/education/third-level-education/fees-and-supports-for-third-level-education/student-grant-scheme/">
           Student
Grant Scheme
          </a>
          . Grant rates for qualifying students vary according to a
number of factors, including household income, family size and whether the
student's college is close to their permanent residence. Since 2012, new
postgraduate students do not qualify for a full student grant but they may
qualify for a partial grant (see below) if they pass particular means tests.
         </p>
         <p>
          The scheme is made up of 3 components - a maintenance grant, a fee grant and
a postgraduate contribution. The maintenance grant is a contribution towards
the student’s living costs. The fee grant can cover any of the following 3
elements: tuition fees, students contribution and cost of essential field
trips. The postgraduate contribution may be payable to a postgraduate who
passes a special means test.
         </p>
         <p>
          In general if you qualify for a maintenance grant you will also qualify for
whatever elements of a fee grant apply to your situation.

          <strong>
           You cannot get a maintenance grant and a BTEA or a VTOS allowance
together.
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          If you have completed a course and now wish to progress to a course at a
higher level, you can continue to retain your BTEA payment (generally up to and
including level 8 on the National Framework of Qualifications). However, you
will no longer be entitled to the maintenance component of the student grant.
You can apply under the grant scheme to have the student contribution and any
tuition fees/field trip costs paid on your behalf under the fee component of
the student grant (if you qualify) and for a postgraduate fee contribution (if
relevant).
         </p>

          Fee grant

of the student grant but you
          <em>
           can
          </em>
          apply for a fee grant to cover the
student contribution and any course tuition fees not already covered by the

           Free
Fees Scheme
          </a>
          . Essential field trip costs may also be covered under a fee
grant.
         </p>
         <p>
          Please note, however, that people getting BTEA may not qualify for payment
of a fee grant – unless they meet the terms and conditions of the student
grant scheme. If you are getting the BTEA and wish to apply for these charges
to be covered by a fee grant you should apply for a grant as soon as
possible.

          , you are entitled to retain it for a period of 3 years from the date
of entry to full-time education, after which you will be re-assessed.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you are currently getting the One-Parent Family Payment, changes in your
family circumstances while you are in full-time education might affect your
eligibility for the payment (for example, if a child no longer lives with you
or goes over the age limit). You should factor any such changes into your
planning for income support during your course.
         </p>
         <p>
          From 4 July 2013, if you had opted to stay on your OFP and go back to
education but no longer qualify for OFP due to changes in the ages limits you
may be admitted to BTEA ‘mid course’. However you cannot get BTEA and a
student grant together.
         </p>
         <p>
          There is a special arrangement for people whose OFP claim ended on 2 July
2015. If you had opted to stay on your OFP and go back to education but no
longer qualify for OFP because your youngest child is 7 years of age or over,
you can stay on OFP until you finish your course. You can continue to claim a
maintenance grant.
          <strong>
           This arrangement was only for people whose OFP claim
ended on

          .
         </p>
         <p>
          A separate arrangement is now in place where you can move to the Jobseeker's
Transitional payment (JST) and continue your course. You can claim JST and a
maintenance grant at the same time. However you will no longer qualify for Rent
Supplement. It is important to remember that your entitlement to JST will end
when your youngest child reaches the age of 14. If you have not finished your
course when your youngest child reaches the age of 14 you will have to either
transfer to the Back to Education Allowance to complete your course or opt to
remain in receipt of your student grant.

          transfer to BTEA to keep a social welfare payment
(including secondary benefits) during full-time education. The reason for this
is that you cannot be genuinely available for and seeking employment when
participating in full-time education.

         <p>
          If you qualify for the Back to Education Allowance, you can keep your
entitlement to any secondary benefits you already have, for example, Fuel
Allowance, Rent Supplement and Mortgage Interest Supplement. Since the
2016/2017 academic year, people getting BTEA who take up work during the
academic year will be assessed under the rules (including means assessment)
that apply to their primary payment - the payment they qualified for BTEA from.
This only applies new applicants or people who return to BTEA after a break.

          Once you transfer from JA or JB to the BTEA, you are not eligible for the
maintenance component of the student grant but you can apply for a fee grant
– covering the student contribution, field trip costs and fees (if payable)
under the student grant scheme. You should do this as soon as possible.

         <p>
          People coming from jobseeker’s payments or Farm Assist are paid BTEA for

          The following case studies show the options available to people on different
types of social welfare payments and the advantages and disadvantages of each
option.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           A: I’m getting Jobseeker’s Allowance and starting a full-time
course in further or higher education:
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          You cannot get Jobseeker’s Allowance (JA) and attend full-time education.
If you are getting Jobseeker’s Allowance you should apply for the Back to
Education Allowance (BTEA). If you qualify, your rate of payment on BTEA will
be the same as the payment you were getting (if you were getting an age-related
reduced rate of JA you get a standard BTEA rate of €220) and you will keep
any secondary benefits you are getting. You do not get the maintenance
component of the student grant with BTEA, but you will be financially better
off on BTEA than you would be on the maintenance grant alone.
         </p>
         <p>
          Since the 2016/2017 academic year, people getting BTEA who take up work
during the academic year will be assessed under the rules (including means
assessment) that apply to their primary payment - the payment they qualified
for BTEA from. This only applies new applicants or people who return to BTEA
after a break. Previously part-time work during the academic year did not
affect the rate of BTEA paid.
         </p>
         <p>
          You must still apply to be assessed for the fee component of the student
grant, covering the student contribution and any tuition fees or essential
field trip costs and for a postgraduate fee contribution (if relevant). You
should submit your application immediately.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           B: I’m getting a One-Parent Family Payment and starting a
full-time course in further or higher education:
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          If you are getting a One-Parent Family Payment you have two options and you
need to work out which will give you the higher income.
         </p>
         <p>
          1.
          <strong>
           You can stay on your One-Parent Family Payment and apply for a
student grant.
          </strong>
          If you choose this option you will continue to get your
One-Parent Family Payment at your current rate and may qualify for the student
grant. However, you will lose any secondary benefits you are getting such as
Rent Supplement or Mortgage Interest Supplement.
         </p>
         <p>
          2.
          <strong>
           You can transfer from your One-Parent Family Payment to the
BTEA.
          </strong>
          If you choose this option and qualify for BTEA, you will not get
the maintenance component of the student grant. Your rate of payment on BTEA
will be the same as the rate of One-Parent Family Payment you were getting and
you can keep any secondary benefits you may be getting.
         </p>
         <p>
          Since the 2016/2017 academic year, people getting BTEA who take up work
during the academic year will be assessed under the rules (including means
assessment) that apply to their primary payment - the payment they qualified
for BTEA from. This only applies new applicants or people who return to BTEA
after a break. Previously part-time work during the academic year did not
affect the rate of BTEA paid.
         </p>
         <p>
          You must still apply to be assessed for the fee component of the student
grant, covering the student contribution and any tuition fees/essential field
trip costs and for a postgraduate fee contribution (if relevant). You should
submit your application immediately.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           C: I’m getting a Disability Allowance and starting a full-time
course in further or higher education:
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          If you are getting a Disability Allowance (DA) you have 2 options and you
need to work out which will give you the higher income.
         </p>
         <p>
          1. You can stay on your Disability Allowance and apply for a student grant.
If you choose this option you will continue to get your Disability Allowance at
your current rate. However, you will lose secondary benefits such as Rent
Supplement or Mortgage Interest Supplement. If you are living at home, your
parents’ income could affect the amount of grant you get. It may mean you get
a reduced amount of maintenance grant, or just the fee component of the student
grant, or neither. If your course of study has an Erasmus component (study at a
college abroad), your DA payment will not be paid while you are absent from the
State.
         </p>
         <p>
          2. You can transfer from your Disability Allowance to the Back to Education
Allowance (BTEA). If you choose this option and qualify for BTEA you will not
get the maintenance component of the student grant. Your rate of payment on
BTEA will be the same as the rate of Disability Allowance you were getting and
you can keep any secondary benefits you may be getting. Your BTEA will continue
to be paid if you are required to study abroad for an Erasmus year.
         </p>
         <p>
          Since the 2016/2017 academic year, people getting BTEA who take up work
during the academic year will be assessed under the rules (including means
assessment) that apply to their primary payment - the payment they qualified
for BTEA from. This only applies to new applicants or people who return to BTEA
after a break. Previously part-time work during the academic year did not

grant, covering the student contribution and any tuition fees/essential field
trip costs and for a postgraduate fee contribution (if relevant). You should
