           Multi-Unit
Developments Act 2011
          </a>
          regulates the ownership and management of the common
areas of multi-unit developments. The Act provides that before a developer
sells any units:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           An owners' management company must be set up, and
          </li>
          <li>
           The common areas of the development must be transferred to the owners'
    management company
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          A multi-unit development is a development of at least 5 residential units
that share facilities, amenities and services. Multi-unit developments can also
be known as managed estates.
         </p>
         <p>
          The majority of multi-unit developments are apartment blocks, but groups of
houses that share common facilities and have an owners’ management company
are also covered by this term. The Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 also
details some rules for developments with between 2 and 4 residential units. And
to a certain extent, the Act applies to mixed commercial and residential
developments.

          What are a developer's obligations in a multi-unit development?
         </h3>
         <p>
          Before any unit in a multi-unit development can be sold, the developer
must:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Establish an owners’ management company
          </li>
          <li>
           Transfer the common areas of the development to the owners' management
    company at the developer's expense
          </li>
          <li>
           Enter into a contract with the owners' management company which outlines
    the responsibility of the developer to the owner’s management company and
    vice versa. The contract should deal with issues such as compliance with
    statutory requirements, completion of the common areas (for which the
    developer remains responsible), retention money (usually, money retained by
    the company to ensure that the developer completes the project) and dispute
    resolution. (The owners’ management company must have separate legal
    representation in the negotiation of the contract.)
          </li>
          <li>
           Supply a certificate under the Building Control Acts from a suitably
    qualified person regarding compliance with fire safety in the development.
    The
           <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/si/0096.html">
            Multi-Unit
    Developments Act 2011 (Section 3) (Prescribed Persons) Regulations 2011
           </a>
           specify that suitably qualified people are architects, building surveyors
    and chartered engineers.
          </li>
          <li>
           Do all things that are reasonably necessary to ensure that the unit owner
    enjoys the rights and amenities necessary for the reasonable use and
    peaceful occupation of the units.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <h3>
          Transfer of common areas
         </h3>
         <p>
          When the common areas are transferred to the company, the developer still
has the right to be in those common areas in order to complete them. The
developer must have a valid insurance policy for all risks relating to their
use of the multi-unit development. The developer must also indemnify the
owners’ management company against claims in respect of acts or omissions by
the developer during completion works.
         </p>
         <p>
          There is a general obligation on the developer to minimise inconvenience to the
unit owners and ensure that access is available to them at all reasonable
times.

          An owners' management company manages the common areas in a multi-unit
development. The owner of each residential unit is entitled to membership of
the owners’ management company and is generally entitled to one vote. Where
alternative arrangements are already in operation, these may be continued,
provided they are just and equitable.
         </p>
         <p>
          The owners' management company is part of the
          <em>
           conveyancing
          </em>
          procedure for the individual units. Conveyancing is the legal work involved in
buying or selling property. If the unit is sold or transferred to another
person, the membership of the owners’ management company automatically
transfers to the new owner. It is not necessary to formally execute the
transfer or have it approved by the directors of the company.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Act refers to the organisations that manage multi-unit developments as
owners’ management companies even if the organisation is not a company. For
example, an unincorporated group or body may be responsible for the management
but they are under the same obligations as owners’ management companies that
are incorporated as companies.

         <h3>
          Obligations of an owners’ management company
         </h3>

          Owners’ management companies must comply with the specific obligations

          Since August 2020, owners’ management companies have been able to have
virtual general meetings, which means that members can vote online. This change
was introduced during COVID-19 so that companies could hold their general
meetings. It is provided for in the

          Company constitution
         </h4>
         <p>
          The governing document of the owners’ management company is called the
constitution. It sets out the rules for the internal governance of the company,
and its provisions must be in line with company law. Every owners' management
company must have a constitution.
         </p>
         <h4>
          Company directors
         </h4>
         <p>
          Generally, directors of owners' management companies are members of the
company, and have been elected by the wider membership of the company. In most
cases, a director’s term is limited to 3 years. However, a serving director
can be appointed or elected at annual general meetings to serve for further
terms, provided that this is not prohibited by the company’s articles of
association (part of the company constitution) or other governing documents.
         </p>
         <p>
          Owner’s management companies and their directors are responsible for
managing the shared facilities, amenities, and services in their development.

         <p>
          You automatically become a member of an owners’ management company when
you purchase a home in a multi-unit development. The owners’ management
company must give anyone who buys a residential unit a share or membership
certificate.
         </p>
         <p>
          The company must update the register of members with the buyer’s details.
The register of members is a list of the names and addresses of all of the
members of the company. It is required under company law and must be kept at
the company’s registered office and made available for public inspection. The
members must keep the company informed of any relevant changes. If a unit is
let to a tenant, the owner must provide the owners’ management company with
the tenant’s details. Read more about

         <p>
          The company must prepare an annual report and hold an annual meeting to
discuss the report. The report must include details of:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>

of the company agree otherwise.

          <strong>
           Service charges
          </strong>
         </h4>
         <p>
          The company must set-up an annual service charges scheme to pay for:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           The maintenance, insurance and repair of common areas within its control,
    and
          </li>
          <li>
           The provision of common services (for example, refuse collection,
    security, gardening) to unit owners
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          The initial charge can be set without holding a meeting of the members but,
in general, these charges must be approved by a general meeting of the members.
If over 75% of the members do not approve the proposed charge, the existing
charge must remain in place.
         </p>
         <p>
          The service charge cannot be used to pay for matters that are the
responsibility of a developer or builder unless this is agreed in writing by
75% of the members of the company. This approval can only be given if 65% of
the units are sold and can only come into effect 3 years after ownership of the
common areas has been transferred to the owners’ management company.
         </p>
         <p>
          Unit owners must pay the service charge (including developers in the case of
unsold units). The service charge must be calculated on a transparent and fair
basis and expenditure must be properly recorded. Under the 2011 Act, if the
owner is letting out their unit, they can pass the management fees onto their
tenant. However, the landlord and tenant must agree this in advance, and in
practice this is quite unusual.

          </a>
          planning applications for apartment
developments must have a ‘building lifecycle report’. This report aims to
ensure that new developments are properly managed into the future. It should
include an assessment of the long-term running and maintenance costs of an
estate. The report may be useful to the owners’ management company as it
should show the measures the developer considered to manage and reduce running
costs for the benefit of residents. It will also help the owners’ management
company to calculate the annual service charge and the sinking fund
contribution.

         <h4>
          <strong>
           Sinking fund
          </strong>
         </h4>
         <p>
          The owners’ management company must establish a sinking fund within 3
years of being transferred ownership of the development. The sinking fund is
used for spending on refurbishment, improvement or maintenance of a
non-recurring nature in a multi-unit development. Unit owners must make
contributions to the sinking fund (including developers in the case of unsold
units). The 2011 Act provides that the amount to be contributed to the sinking
fund is €200 annually per unit, or such other amount as the members agree.
Contributions to the sinking fund must be held in a separate account.

          <strong>
           House rules
          </strong>
         </h4>
         <p>
          The owners’ management company can make house rules for the effective
operation and maintenance of the multi-unit development. These rules must be
agreed by a meeting of members but the first set of rules can be made by the
company before the sale of the first unit. If a unit is let to tenants, one of
the terms of the letting should state that tenants must observe the house
rules. You can download a sample of house rules from the

          The company may not enter into contracts with providers of goods and

         <h3>
          Dispute resolution
         </h3>
         <p>
          You can apply to the Circuit Court for an order to enforce any rights or
obligations imposed under the Act. This includes the owners’ management
company, a unit owner, a trustee under a will or other settlement, a tenant and
the developer. The Court, instead of making an order, may direct the parties to
attempt to solve the matter by mediation.

         <p>
          A property management agent is hired by an owners’ management company to
provide services to manage an estate, for example, refuse collection, repairs
and maintenance. Generally, people living in a multi-unit development have more
contact with the agent than with their owners' management company, as the agent
looks after the day-to-day running of the estate. The roles of the owners’
management company and the property management agent are separate, and the
details of the relationship between them are set-out in a contract or letter of
engagement.
         </p>
         <p>
          The agent follows the instructions of the board of directors of the
owners’ management company and is accountable to them for the standard of
services provided. An agent can be involved in the management of a number of
different estates and can work for a number of different owners’ management
companies. Agents are
