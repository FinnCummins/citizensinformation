         <p>
          The European Union (EU) has a limited role in family law matters. Each
individual member state has its own rules about separation, divorce,
maintenance of spouses and children, custody and guardianship and other family
law matters.
         </p>
         <p>
          The role of the EU is ensuring that decisions made in one country can be
implemented in another. It also has a role in trying to establish which country
has jurisdiction to hear a particular case. In effect, the EU does not have
rules which govern, for example, who is entitled to have custody or access but
it does have rules which try to make sure that custody and access orders made
in one country can be put into effect in another.
         </p>
         <h3>
          The problem of conflict of laws
         </h3>
         <p>
          If all the parties to a family law dispute are from one country and are
living in that country then generally the dispute is heard by the courts of
that country, and a decision is made and implemented in accordance with the
laws of that country. Problems arise when the parties are not living in the
same country or are not nationals of the same country. It may not be clear
which country’s courts should make the decisions, which country’s laws
should be applied and how the decisions made in one country can be implemented
in another.
         </p>
         <p>
          Each country has its own rules about how these conflicts of laws should be
dealt with. It is possible that several countries would have jurisdiction to
hear the dispute and that each would apply different laws. The procedures for
having judgments recognised and enforced in another country can be difficult
and sometimes impossible. Generally, if you have a judgment from a court in one
country, you have to go through another judicial process in another country in
order to have it implemented there.
         </p>
         <p>
          These problems arise between all countries and not only between EU member
states. A number of international conventions have been agreed dealing with
such conflicts of laws. These international conventions continue to apply
between EU member states and non-EU member states. The EU regulations in family
law matters apply in all the EU member states except Denmark which has opted
out. So if there is a conflict of laws involving Denmark and another EU member
state, the matter is governed by the international conventions if they are
relevant.
         </p>
         <p>
          Within the EU, there has been a simplified process for implementing certain
judgments and orders from one EU member state in another. An even more
streamlined process within the EU now applies to many orders relating to
matrimonial matters and parental responsibility which were made in proceedings
which started on or after 1 August 2022.
         </p>
         <h3>
          EU competence to deal with family law
         </h3>
         <p>
          The EU is only able to make laws in areas where EU treaties give it the
specific power to do so. It cannot make laws in relation to divorce,
maintenance or parental responsibility. This means the EU cannot make laws
setting out the terms under which a divorce may be granted, or the
responsibility of spouses to pay maintenance, or how decisions on custody and
access to children are to be made.
         </p>
         <p>
          However, the EU does have responsibility to promote judicial (legal)
co-operation in civil matters which have cross border implications. It has made
a number of regulations dealing with judicial co-operation. In general, these
regulations are based on the principle of mutual recognition – that is, that
decisions lawfully made in one EU country should be recognised and enforced in
other EU countries and the procedures for doing so should be as simple as
possible.

          Matrimonial matters (divorce, separation and annulment) and parental
responsibility
         </h3>
         <p>
          On 1 August 2022,
          <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2019.178.01.0001.01.ENG&amp;toc=OJ%3AL%3A2019%3A178%3ATOC">
           Regulation
2019/1111
          </a>
          came into effect. It sets out the rules governing the
jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of matrimonial and parental
responsibility orders in the EU in respect of legal proceedings that start
after 1 August 2022 and agreements made after that date.
         </p>
         <p>
          <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=LEGISSUM:l33194">
           Regulation
2201/2003
          </a>
          also sets out the rules governing the jurisdiction, recognition
and enforcement of matrimonial and parental responsibility orders in the EU.
However, it applies to legal proceedings that began before 1 August 2022 and
agreements made before that date.
         </p>
         <p>
          The scope of the Regulations is confined to matrimonial matters (divorce,
legal separation, annulment) while parental responsibility includes rights of
custody and rights of access, guardianship, the placement of a child in a
foster family or in institutional care.

         </p>
         <h3>
          Jurisdiction
         </h3>
         <p>
          Regulations 2019/1111 and 2201/2013 provide that you may take a matrimonial
action in the courts of the EU member state where:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           one or both of you are or were habitually resident, or
          </li>
          <li>
           the member state of your common nationality, or
          </li>
          <li>
           your common
           <a href="https://www.citizensinformation.ie/money_and_tax/tax/moving_country_and_taxation/tax_residence_and_domicile_in_ireland.html">
            domicile
           </a>
           .
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          This means, of course, that it may be possible to take the action in a
number of states. The Regulation provides that once proceedings have started in
a particular member state, other states must refuse jurisdiction.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Regulation does not deal with the question of which law applies. This is
a matter for the member state that has jurisdiction. For example, most
countries other than Ireland apply the law of the country of
          <a href="https://www.citizensinformation.ie/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">
           habitual
residence
          </a>
          of the parties while Ireland applies the law of the country of
          <a href="https://www.citizensinformation.ie/money_and_tax/tax/moving_country_and_taxation/tax_residence_and_domicile_in_ireland.html">
           domicile
          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <h3>
          Recognition of decisions
         </h3>
         <p>
          The Regulation provides that a decision on a matrimonial matter made in one
member state must be recognised and enforced in the other states without any
special procedures. You do not have to go to court to have it recognised.
However, any interested party may ask the court in the other member state not
to recognise the decision. The court may refuse to recognise the decision:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           If such recognition is clearly contrary to public policy
          </li>
          <li>
           If the decision contradicts another decision
          </li>
          <li>
           If there were certain procedural defects with the decision – in
    particular if one party was not properly served with the relevant papers
    and did not put in an appearance as a result
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          The court is not entitled to hear an appeal against the foreign decision.
         </p>
         <h3>
          The law applicable to international divorces
         </h3>
         <p>
          <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1422886426094&amp;uri=URISERV:l33194">
           Regulation
2201/2003
          </a>
          or
          <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2019.178.01.0001.01.ENG&amp;toc=OJ%3AL%3A2019%3A178%3ATOC">
           2019/1111
          </a>
          do not determine what law applies when an application for divorce is being
considered. For example, if an Irish person living in Spain wants to divorce a
German spouse who is living in France, which national law applies?
         </p>
         <p>
          <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32010R1259">
           Regulation
1259/2010
          </a>
          (known as "the Rome III Regulation") implementing enhanced
cooperation in the area of the law applicable to divorce and legal separation
currently applies in 17 member states. Ireland has not opted into this
Regulation. The Regulation allows international couples in the member states
where it applies to agree in advance which law will apply to their divorce or
legal separation, as long as the agreed law is the law of the member state with
which they have a closer connection. In case the couple cannot agree, the judge
can use a common formula for deciding which country's law applies.

           Regulation
2019/1111
          </a>
          sets out the rules on jurisdiction and the recognition and

cases arising on or after 1 August 2022.
         </p>
         <p>
          They apply in a very wide variety of situations. For example:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           The parents do not need to be married to each other.
          </li>
          <li>
           The holders of parental responsibility need not be the biological parents
    of the child in question.
          </li>
          <li>
           It is not confined to court judgments as it applies to agreements between
    parents if such agreements are enforceable in the country where they were
    made.

           2019/111
          </a>
          cover the following aspects of parental responsibility:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Jurisdiction – what country should hear the case
          </li>
          <li>
           Recognition and enforcement – how decisions made in one country are to
    be recognised and enforced in another
          </li>

           Co-operation between central authorities

          <li>
           Specific rules on international child abduction and access rights
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Parental responsibility includes rights of custody and rights of access,
guardianship, the placement of a child in a foster family or in institutional
care. The Regulation does not apply to proceedings which involve:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Establishing and challenging maternity and paternity
          </li>
          <li>
           Judgments in relation to adoption
          </li>
          <li>
           The child's first and last names
          </li>
          <li>
           Age of majority
          </li>
          <li>
           Trusts and inheritance
          </li>
          <li>
           Measures taken following criminal offences committed by children
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          The Regulation also applies to certain measures concerning the child’s
property if they are related to the protection of the child.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Jurisdiction
         </h3>
         <p>
          The general rule is that the court which has jurisdiction in matters of
parental responsibility is the court of the country where the child is
habitually resident. Again, in general, once the matter is before the courts in
one country, that country continues to have jurisdiction even if the child has
recently lawfully changed country of residence. It is possible to have the case
transferred to the new country of residence if certain conditions are met and
if it would be in the best interests of the child.
         </p>
         <p>
          The parents may agree to have the question of parental responsibility
decided in the court which has jurisdiction on the matrimonial matter (for
example, divorce, annulment or legal separation) or may agree to have the case
heard by the court of a country with which the child has a close connection
(for example, nationality).
         </p>
         <p>
          If the child's habitual residence cannot be established, then the EU country
in which the child is present has jurisdiction.
         </p>
         <p>
          In certain circumstances, the court which has jurisdiction may refer the
case to another court if that other court is better placed to hear the case and
this is in the best interests of the child. This could arise, for example, if
the child’s habitual residence has changed. There are time limits on this
procedure. If a child’s habitual residence changes as a result of a wrongful
removal or retention, jurisdiction may move only under very strict
conditions.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Regulation also includes rules on what is to happen if the proceedings
are started in more than one member state.
         </p>
         <p>
          In urgent cases, a court may take provisional protective measures even if
another member state has jurisdiction on the substantive issue.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Recognition and enforcement
         </h3>
         <p>
          Judgments given in one member state must be recognised and enforced in
another member state. The court in the other member state may refuse to
recognise the order only on the grounds that:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           It would be manifestly contrary to that member state’s public
  policy
          </li>
          <li>
           The child was not given an opportunity to be heard (except in urgent
    cases)
          </li>
          <li>
           The judgment was given in the absence of a person who was not served with
    the documents instituting the proceedings in sufficient time and in such a
    way as to enable them to arrange for their defence
          </li>
          <li>
           A person claiming that the judgment infringes their parental
    responsibility was not given the opportunity to be heard
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          If you are applying to a court in another member state for recognition and
enforcement, you are entitled to legal aid there if you were entitled in your
own state. You may also get help from the Central Authority in the country
where you are seeking recognition and enforcement.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Co-operation between national authorities
         </h3>
         <p>
          The Regulations create a system of co-operation between Central Authorities
of the member states. These authorities are obliged to facilitate
communications between the courts of the relevant countries and must facilitate
agreements between parents through mediation or other means.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Child abduction
         </h3>
         <p>
          Child abduction is the unlawful removal or retention of a child. If you have
custody of a child and your child is abducted to another member state, you may
apply to that state for the return of the child. The courts of the member state
to which the child has been abducted can only refuse return of the child in
limited circumstances – for example, if there are not adequate safeguards to
ensure that there is no serious risk that return would expose the child to
harm.
         </p>
         <p>
          In general, the court must order the immediate return of the child. You can

          The recognition and enforcement of maintenance orders in EU member states is
governed by
          <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1422886426094&amp;uri=URISERV:jl0024">
           Regulation
4/2009
          </a>
          (also known as ‘the Maintenance Regulation’). Its objective is
to help a maintenance creditor (applicant) to establish easily, quickly and
generally free of charge, an order which can be enforced throughout the
European Union. It does this by providing for common rules in relation to
jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition, enforcement, cooperation and
standardised documents. It covers maintenance obligations which arise from:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Family relationships
          </li>
          <li>
           Parentage
          </li>
          <li>
           Marriage or affinity
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          It means that a person who has an order for the payment of maintenance given
in an Irish court is in a position to look for recovery of that amount in
another EU country. The same service is available to those in other EU member
states who are seeking recovery of maintenance against debtors (respondents)
living in Ireland.
         </p>
         <p>
          Under the Regulation, each member state has a Central Authority. The Central
Authority in Ireland is the
          <a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/WP15000151">
           Department of
Justice
          </a>
          . The central authorities co-operate with each other in facilitating
the operation of the Regulation. They also assist individuals in relation to
applications available under the Regulation, particularly with regard to the
transmission and receipt of applications, the initiation of related proceedings
for the establishment or modification of maintenance, and for the enforcement
of a maintenance decision.

          On 23 June 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) voted to leave the European Union
(EU). Following a

           transition
period

longer a member of the EU.

           Brexit

          affects a number of family law issues with a cross-border element. So, for
example, there may be changes in how certain aspects of custody and maintenance
applications are processed when one parent lives in the EU and one parent lives
in the UK. The old basis for recognising UK divorces has also changed although
they will still be recognised in Ireland under new rules.

          Any cross-border custody or access orders that were in place at the end of
the transition period remain in effect. So, orders affecting a child with
parents/guardians in both Ireland and the UK are unaffected. If you had an
ongoing case about arrangements for your children at the end of the transition
period, your case will continue under the old rules.
         </p>
         <p>
          However, if you applied for custody or access after the end of the
transition period, different rules may apply for having the order made or
accepted in Ireland or the UK. In general, cross-border parental responsibility
issues involving Ireland and the UK will be governed by the
