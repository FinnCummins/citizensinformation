          PRSI (social insurance) contribution

         <p>
          Paternity Benefit is paid by the Department of Social Protection to people
who have a certain number of paid PRSI contributions on their social insurance
record. The PRSI contributions can be from both employment and self-employment.
The PRSI classes that count for Paternity Benefit are A, E, H and S
(self-employed). Members of the Defence Forces who pay PRSI at Class H are
insured for Paternity Benefit but it is not payable while they are in
service.

          <strong>
           If you are an employee
          </strong>
          you must have:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           At least 39 weeks PRSI paid in the 12-month period before the first day

           At least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work

            and
           </span>
           at
    least 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year or in the tax
    year immediately following the relevant tax year. For example, if you are
    going on paternity leave in 2023, the relevant tax year is 2021 and the
    year following that is 2022.

           </span>
           at

         <p>
          If you do not meet these PRSI conditions and you were self-employed before
starting work as an employee, you can use your Class S contributions to qualify
for Paternity Benefit - see PRSI conditions for self-employed people below.
         </p>
         <p>
          You are awarded

           credited
contributions or credits
          </a>
          automatically when you are getting Paternity
Benefit. Credits are awarded at the same rate as your last paid contribution.
These credits help protect your future entitlement to social welfare benefits
and pensions.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you were previously insurably employed in a country covered by EU
Regulations, you may combine your insurance record in that country with your
Irish PRSI contributions to help you qualify for Paternity Benefit in Ireland.
You must be currently in insurable employment in Ireland and have paid your
most recent PRSI contribution in Ireland. More information is available in our
document about

          <strong>
           If you are self-employed
          </strong>
          you must be in insurable
employment and have:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           52 weeks PRSI contributions paid at Class S in the relevant tax year. For
    example, if you are going on paternity leave in 2023, the relevant tax year
    is 2021.

         </ul>

         <ul>
          <li>
           52 weeks PRSI contributions paid at Class S in the tax year immediately
    before the relevant tax year. For example, if you are going on paternity
    leave in 2023, the tax year immediately before the relevant tax year is
    2020.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>

          <li>
           52 weeks PRSI contributions paid at Class S in the tax year immediately
    following the relevant tax year. For example, if you are going on paternity
    leave in 2023, the tax year immediately following the relevant tax year is
    2022.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          If you do not meet these PRSI conditions and you were in insurable
employment before becoming self-employed, you can use your PRSI contributions
(Class A, E and H) in that employment to qualify for Paternity Benefit – see
PRSI conditions for employed people above.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you are in insurable self-employment, you are not awarded credited
contributions or credits automatically when you are getting Paternity Benefit.
A self-employed person is not specifically excluded from employment credits.
You may qualify for credits if you meet the conditions. For example, an
applicant for Paternity Benefit who is now self-employed but had been employed
in 2020 would qualify for credits. If they have been only self-employed,
without being employed, for the last 3 years they won’t qualify for
credits.

         <h3>
          Leave certification
         </h3>
         <p>
          All employees must have their paternity leave certified by their employer.
If you are self-employed you self-certify your leave.
         </p>
         <p>
          You must notify your employer that you intend to take paternity leave and of
your intended dates no later than 4 weeks before your leave.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you're an employee, you must notify your employer that you intend to take
paternity leave and of your intended dates no later than 4 weeks before your
leave. You must provide your employer with proof of the expected date of
confinement of your spouse or partner. In other words, you will be required to
provide your employer with a certificate from your spouse or partner's doctor
confirming when your baby is due, or confirmation of the baby’s actual date
of birth if you apply for leave after the birth has occurred. Your employer
must then complete a

expected due date of your baby (or the baby's date of birth). This is to
confirm that you are entitled to paternity leave.
         </p>
         <p>
          In the case of adoption, you must produce a certificate of placement in
relation to the child.
         </p>
         <p>
          In the case of an intercountry adoption that took place outside the State,
you must produce a declaration of eligibility and suitability in relation to
the child and particulars in writing of the day of placement or expected day of
placement.
         </p>
         <p>
          If at any stage you decide not to take your paternity leave, you cannot be
paid Paternity Benefit. You should inform the Paternity Benefit section of the
Department of Social Protection of any changes to your paternity leave
arrangements.

          Payments for dependants
         </h3>
         <p>
          If you have dependants, your rate of Paternity Benefit (excluding increases
for dependants) is compared to the rate of Illness Benefit (including increases
for dependants) that would be paid to you if you were absent from work through
illness. The higher of the 2 rates is paid to you.
         </p>
         <p>
          Although the Illness Benefit rate begins from a lower personal base amount
(€220 is the maximum Illness Benefit personal rate), it also takes into
account extra payments for your family. This is why, depending on the
circumstances of your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant and how many children
you have, the rate paid to you may be greater than the rate you would otherwise
be entitled to.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Example (2023 rates):
          </strong>
          John is entitled to the standard
Paternity Benefit rate of €262. His partner is unemployed and signing on for
          <a href="/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/credited-social-insurance-contributions/">
           unemployment
credits
          </a>
          . They have two children under 12 years of age. If he got
          <a href="/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/disability-and-illness/disability-benefit/">
           Illness Benefit
          </a>
          he would get €450 (this is the personal rate of Illness Benefit + an Increase
for a Qualified Adult + Increases for 2 Qualified Children under 12). He cannot
get less Paternity Benefit than he would get if ill and getting Illness
Benefit. For this reason, he will get Paternity Benefit of €450.
         </p>

          If your adult dependant is getting a social welfare payment you will not get

          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          You will qualify for a full-rate IQA and a full-rate IQC, if your adult
dependant is unemployed and signing on for credits or is earning under
€100.01 per week.
         </p>
         <p>
          If your adult dependant is earning between €100.01 and €310 per week you
will get a tapered rate of IQA and a full-rate IQC. If your adult dependant is
earning between €310.01 and €400 per week you will not get an IQA but you
will get half rate IQC. If your adult dependant earns over €400 per week you
will not get an IQA or IQC.

          Payment abroad
         </h3>
         <p>
          EU and non-EU citizens can holiday abroad and get Paternity Benefit for a
maximum of 2 weeks while away.
         </p>
         <p>
          To get Paternity Benefit while abroad, you need to inform Paternity Benefit
Section of your intended absence either by email at: paternityben@welfare.ie or
by calling (01) 471 5898.
         </p>
         <h3>
          How the payment is made
         </h3>
         <p>
          Paternity Benefit is paid directly into your bank or building society
account (a current or deposit account, not a mortgage account) or you can
choose to have it paid directly into your employer's bank account.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Note:
          </strong>
          Some employers will continue to pay an employee, in
full, while the employee is on paternity leave. In such cases the employer will
generally require the employee to have any Paternity Benefit paid to them. You
should check your contract of employment to see what applies to you.
