          A Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) is one of 3 debt resolution
mechanisms introduced by the
          <a href="http://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/2012/act/44/revised/en/html">
           Personal
Insolvency Act 2012
          </a>
          for people who cannot afford to pay their personal
debts. These mechanisms offer different solutions to people in different
situations.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Personal Insolvency Arrangement applies to the agreed settlement and/or
restructuring of secured debts up to a total of €3 million (as well as
unsecured debts) over a period of up to 6 years. The cap of €3 million can be
increased by agreement with your secured creditors and the limit of 6 years can
increase to 7 years in some situations.
         </p>
         <p>
          This page describes how to qualify for a PIA and how the PIA process
works.

          Provision for court review
         </h3>
         <p>
          Where a mortgage lender rejects the borrower’s proposal for a PIA, an
application can be made for a court review of that rejection. Since 25 June
2021, all mortgages in arrears or the subject to an alternative payment
arrangement can seek a court review of the rejection. Before 25 June 2021, this
review option only applied to mortgages that were in arrears on 1 January 2015,
or to mortgages that were in arrears before that and where the borrower entered
into an
          <a href="/en/housing/owning-a-home/mortgage-arrears/alternative-repayment-arrangements/">
           alternative
repayment arrangement

          As part of

representation for eligible borrowers in seeking such a court review.
         </p>
         <p>
          The court will review the application, including any objections made by
creditors. Subject to meeting certain criteria set out in the legislation, the
judge may impose the original PIA proposal on the creditor(s).

          Personal Insolvency Arrangements provide for the agreed settlement and/or
restructuring of debts in the case of people who have secured debts up to a
total of €3 million (as well as any unsecured debts) and have no prospect of
being able to pay off their debts in the next 5 years.
         </p>
         <p>
          You can only avail of a PIA once in your lifetime. You cannot get a PIA if
you are involved in one of the other debt resolution processes introduced by
the Act, or in the
          <a href="/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/what-is-bankruptcy/">
           bankruptcy
          </a>
          process,
or if you have completed one of these processes within the last 5 years (3
years for a Debt Relief Notice).
         </p>
         <p>
          Under the original legislation, you could only get a PIA by agreement of a
specified majority of your secured and unsecured creditors – see
          <a href="personal_insolvency_arrangements.en.html#l2864b">
           Main elements of a
PIA
          </a>
          below. However, as noted above, you can now seek a court review if a
mortgage lender rejects your personal insolvency proposal. See ‘Creditors’
meeting’ below for more detail.
         </p>
         <p>
          You must be domiciled in the State, or else have been living or had a place
of business in the State within the year before you make your application.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Qualifying debts
         </h3>
         <p>
          You will only qualify for a PIA if you owe debt to at least one secured
creditor holding security over Irish property or assets (secured debt). If you
have no secured debts you should apply for a
          <a href="/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/debt-settlement-arrangements/">
           Debt Settlement Arrangement
          </a>
          or
a
          <a href="/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/debt-relief-notices/">
           Debt Relief Notice
          </a>
          . In general, the
total of your debt to your secured creditors must add up to less than €3
million. However, this cap can be waived if all of your secured creditors agree
in writing.
         </p>
         <p>
          At least three-quarters (75%) of your debts must have built up at least 6
months before you apply for a PIA – in other words, you can’t apply for a
PIA if any more than 25% of your debts were incurred in the last 6 months.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Secured and unsecured debts
         </h3>
         <p>
          A Personal Insolvency Arrangement is only for people who have
          <em>
           secured
          </em>
          debts (though it can include unsecured debts – see below) so
it is important to know whether your debts are secured or not.
         </p>
         <p>
          A
          <em>
           secured
          </em>
          debt is a loan on which property or goods are available
as security against non-payment. Mortgages and car loans are the most common
secured loans.
         </p>
         <p>
          Some examples of
          <em>
           unsecured
          </em>
          debts are: utility bill arrears (gas,
electricity etc.); credit card debt; bank overdrafts; credit union loans.
However, if they are rolled up into your mortgage, they become secured
loans.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Excluded and excludable debts
         </h3>
         <p>
          The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 specifies certain types of debt that
          <strong>
           cannot
          </strong>
          be written off by the debt settlement procedures that
it introduced, which include the Personal Insolvency Arrangement. These are
called
          <em>
           excluded
          </em>
          debts.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Act specifies certain other types of debt to be
          <em>
           excludable
          </em>
          from
a PIA. This means that they can be covered by the PIA if the creditor is asked
and agrees to let them be included – in which case they become
          <em>
           permitted
          </em>
          debts – debts that the creditor permits to be covered. If
the creditor is asked and does not respond, the creditor is also deemed to have
consented to the debts being included. Most types of excludable debts are those
owed to the State.
         </p>
         <p>
          The types of debt that are
          <em>
           excluded
          </em>
          and cannot be covered by a PIA
are:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Debts under family law orders, such as

            maintenance
    orders
           </a>
           for spouses and children
          </li>
          <li>
           Debts due under court awards for personal injury or death
          </li>
          <li>
           Debts arising from a loan (or forbearance of a loan) obtained through
    fraud or similar wrongdoing
          </li>
          <li>
           Debts arising under court orders made under the Proceeds of Crime Acts or
    fines imposed by the courts for criminal offences
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          The types of debt that are
          <em>
           excludable
          </em>
          and may be covered if the
creditor agrees are:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Taxes, duties, charges or levies owed to the State, such as income tax,

you have been unable to agree an alternative repayment arrangement or the
lender has confirmed in writing that it does not wish to enter into such an
arrangement.

          This rule does not apply if your Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) –

          You must make your proposal for a PIA through a Personal Insolvency
Practitioner (PIP) – see
          <a href="personal_insolvency_arrangements.en.html#le8b6d">
           The PIA process
          </a>
          below.
         </p>
         <p>
          Once you have agreed the terms of the PIA proposal with your PIP, you then
need approval from a creditors’ meeting or, failing that, your proposal may
be imposed on your creditors after a court review. See ‘Creditors’
meeting’ below’ for more detail.
         </p>
         <p>
          A PIA may involve you making regular payments of agreed amounts to your
Personal Insolvency Practitioner, who then distributes them to your creditors
according to the terms of the PIA.
         </p>
         <p>
          Your creditors may not take any action against you to enforce the debt
during the lifetime of the PIA. If you keep to the terms of the PIA, the rest
of your debt to your unsecured creditors will be discharged. However, when the
PIA ends, you will still be liable for the outstanding amount of your secured
debts, such as your mortgage.

           Cross-border recognition

         <p>
          The PIA has been designated as an insolvency proceeding which can benefit
from cross-border recognition. This means that a debtor availing of a PIA will
gain the same protection against creditors in most other EU countries that they
receive in Ireland, subject to and in accordance with the

         <h3>
          Mandatory terms of a PIA
         </h3>
         <p>
          There are certain elements that the PIA
          <strong>
           must
          </strong>
          contain:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           The maximum duration of the agreement must be 6 years but this may be
    extended by up to 1 year in circumstances as specified in the terms of the
    arrangement
          </li>
          <li>
           The PIA must clearly distinguish between secured debts and unsecured
    debts and must make provision for the manner in which the security held by
    the creditor is to be treated. Unless your secured creditors agree
    otherwise, they may get the full value of their security or the full amount
    of the debt if the property is sold. If they agree to accept less than the
    full value of the security, there is a clawback if the security is sold for
    greater than the value estimated at the time of the arrangement.
          </li>
          <li>
           If you keep to the terms of the agreement your remaining debts to your
    unsecured creditors will be discharged
          </li>
          <li>
           You remain liable for certain debts unless the proposed arrangement
    explicitly provides for a compromise agreement and the creditor has agreed
    in writing to accept this – see ‘Excluded and excludable debts’
  above
          </li>
          <li>
           The PIA cannot release you from fines or other monetary penalties arising
    from criminal offences
          </li>
          <li>
           It cannot require you to sell any assets that are reasonably necessary
    for your employment or business unless you agree to such a sale
          </li>
          <li>
           You must be left with
           <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/RLE_calculated">
            enough income to
    maintain a reasonable standard of living
           </a>
           for yourself and your
    dependants
          </li>
          <li>
           It must not require you to dispose of your principal private residence
    (your home) or to cease to occupy it unless specific conditions are met –
    see ‘Secured creditors’ below
          </li>
          <li>
           It must outline how your debts will be treated in the event of your death
    or mental incapacity
          </li>
          <li>
           It must provide that your circumstances be reviewed by the Personal
    Insolvency Practitioner at regular intervals (not more than 12 months)
    during the currency of the PIA; this review will involve the preparation of
    a new Prescribed Financial Statement that must be sent to all the
  creditors.
          </li>
          <li>
           It must make provision for the Personal Insolvency Practitioner’s
  costs
          </li>
         </ul>
         <h3>
          Pension income
         </h3>
         <p>
          Ongoing pension income receivable by you or an entitlement to a pension lump
sum or income in accordance with the tax code will be treated as an asset or,
as applicable, income for the purposes of a PIA. The terms of the PIA may
provide for payment of some or all of that pension/lump sum or income to
creditors during the PIA period.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Pension fund
         </h3>
         <p>
          Your pension fund will be excluded from any PIA if it is a
          <em>
           relevant
pension arrangement
          </em>
          for the purposes of the Act. Approved Retirement Funds
(ARFs) do not fall into this category and may be included in a PIA. There will
be an onus on you to be transparent in relation to all historical pension
contributions and the PIP will review these.
         </p>
         <p>
          If a creditor or your PIP considers that you have made excessive pension
contributions in the 3 years before applying for a PIA, an application can be
made to the court to recover these contributions for distribution to your
creditors.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Credit
         </h3>
         <p>
          While the PIA is in effect, you may not get credit for any amount over
€650 without informing the lender that you have a PIA. You may not sell or
deal in property above a certain value, except in accordance with the terms of
the PIA. However, no such restriction is placed on your spouse or civil
partner.

          <a href="https://www.isi.gov.ie/">
           Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI)
          </a>
          and will
act on your behalf throughout the Personal Insolvency Arrangement.
         </p>
         <p>
          The ISI has developed
          <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/Protocol_Team">
           standard protocols
          </a>
          for use by PIPs when making straightforward proposals to creditors for a PIA or
a Debt Settlement Arrangement.
         </p>
         <p>
          You must disclose all details of your financial affairs to the PIP, who will
then advise you whether or not you meet the conditions for a PIA, the
consequences, any alternative options, and the fees that you may have to pay.
You must act in good faith and co-operate fully with the process.
         </p>
         <p>
          The PIP will help you complete a
          <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/Prescribed_Financial_Statement">
           Prescribed
Financial Statement
          </a>
          as part of your application, giving full and honest
information about your financial circumstances.
         </p>
         <p>
          You must also make a declaration that you have been unable to agree an
alternative repayment arrangement with your creditor(s) or that your
creditor(s) have confirmed in writing that they are unwilling to enter into an
alternative repayment arrangement in respect of your principal private
residence. See ‘Mortgage arrears on your home’ above for specific rules
about mortgage debt.
         </p>
         <p>
          You will have to give your written consent to enable:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           The PIP to disclose your personal data to the ISI
          </li>
          <li>
           The ISI to process your application

    required
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          In general, you must act in good faith and co-operate fully with the
process.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Fees
         </h3>
         <p>
          The ISI has waived its fees for

           the 3 debt solutions

          until 31
December 2023.
         </p>
         <p>
          There is no set scale of fees for PIPs, but they are required to specify
their charges and associated costs clearly before being appointed to act on
your behalf.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Protective certificate
         </h3>
         <p>
          The Personal Insolvency Practitioner sends your application to the ISI. The
ISI checks that all the details are in order and, if so, issues a certificate
to that effect and forwards all to the relevant court (the Circuit Court in
cases up to €2.5 million and the High Court in larger cases). The court
reviews the documentation and, if all is in order, issues a protective
certificate. The ISI records the details of the protective certificate on its
          <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/EN/ISI/PAGES/REGISTER_OF_PCS">
           Register of
Protective Certificates
          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          The PIP then notifies each of your creditors of the existence of the
protective certificate and your intention to make a proposal for a PIA.
         </p>
         <p>
          The protective certificate will give you an initial period of 70 days during
which your creditors may not:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Start or continue legal proceedings in respect of the debt
          </li>
          <li>
           Take or continue any steps to enforce a judgment or contact you about the
    debt unless you agree to this
          </li>
          <li>
           Start or continue bankruptcy proceedings against you
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          The court may extend the period of the protective certificate by up to 40
days if it is satisfied that:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           You and the PIP have acted in good faith and with reasonable expedition,
    and
          </li>
          <li>
           It is likely that, if the extension is granted, a proposal for a PIA will
    be made that is likely to be accepted by the creditors and successfully
    completed by you
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          The court may also extend the period of the protective certificate by up to
40 days, or by a further period up to 40 days, where there are exceptional
circumstances or other circumstances outside your or the PIP’s control.
         </p>
         <p>
          A creditor may apply to the court for an order directing that the protective
certificate not apply to him or her. The court will grant this order only if
satisfied that failing to give it would cause irreparable loss to the creditor
that would not otherwise occur and that no other creditor to whom notice of the
protective certificate has been given would be unfairly prejudiced.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Contacting your creditors
         </h3>
         <p>
          Once the protective certificate has been granted, your PIP must invite the
relevant creditors to make proposals about the manner in which the debts might
be dealt with as part of a PIA. The creditors must be given your Prescribed
Financial Statement.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Secured creditors
         </h3>
         <p>
          The PIA must provide for the way in which security held by your creditors is
treated. Unless they agree otherwise, they may get the full value of their
security or the full amount that you owe them if the security (such as a second
property) is sold.
         </p>
         <p>
          When formulating the proposal for a PIA, the PIP will ensure, as far as is
reasonably practicable, that you are not required to sell or move out of your
principal private residence (your home). If you wish to move out, or if the PIP
believes that the running costs of staying in your home are disproportionately
large, the PIA may provide for you to move out of it.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Creditors’ meeting
         </h3>
         <p>
          When you have consented to the proposal for a PIA that has been formulated
by your PIP, the PIP must call a creditors’ meeting. If there is only one
creditor, he or she may write to the PIP indicating agreement or rejection. The
creditors vote on whether or not to accept the proposed arrangement. Each vote
is proportional to the amount of debt owed to that creditor. Creditors
representing 65% or more of the value of the total debt – both secured and
unsecured – must vote in favour, for the arrangement to be accepted. In
addition, over 50% of your secured creditors and 50% of unsecured creditors
must vote in favour.

         <p>
          If the proposal is accepted, the PIP must inform the Insolvency Service and
tell creditors of their right to object to the relevant court - (the Circuit
Court in cases up to €2.5 million and the High Court in larger cases). The
Insolvency Service notifies the court. If there is any objection, the
protective certificate remains in place until the matter is decided.

          Objections by creditors

          Varying a Personal Insolvency Arrangement

          Personal Insolvency Arrangements may be varied – the procedures are
similar to those for setting up the arrangement.
         </p>
         <p>
          A creditor or a PIP may apply to the court at any time during the Personal
Insolvency Arrangement to have it ended. The grounds for such an application
are limited and include the following:

         <ul>
          <li>
           Your Prescribed Financial Statement has a material inaccuracy or omission

          Ending of a Personal Insolvency Arrangement
         </h3>
         <p>
          If the arrangement ends other than by successful completion, you will become
fully liable for all specified debts,
          <strong>
           inclusive
          </strong>
          of arrears,
charges and interest that have accrued during the PIA period,
          <strong>
           less
          </strong>
          any payments made by you during that time,
          <strong>
           unless
          </strong>
          the terms of the PIA specify, or the court has ordered,
otherwise.
         </p>
         <p>
          If the arrangement is successfully completed, you are discharged from the
unsecured debts covered by the arrangement.
          <strong>
           You will not be discharged
from the secured debts, except where this was explicitly provided for in the
PIA.
          </strong>
          The successful completion is recorded on the Register of Personal
Insolvency Arrangements.
