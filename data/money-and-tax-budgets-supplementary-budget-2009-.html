         <p>
          A package of measures will be implemented to facilitate better access to the
Back to Enterprise Allowance Scheme (BTWEA):
         </p>
         <ul>

    4 years to 2 years.
          </li>
          <li>

    12 months provided you have an underlying entitlement to Jobseeker's
    Allowance.
          </li>
          <li>

    your entitlement, you can participate a second time after period of at
    least 5 years has elapsed.
          </li>
          <li>
           If you qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit (with 104 contributions paid in
    the past 2 years) or you have been awarded statutory redundancy you may get
    immediate access to a shorter BTWEA. In this case, the allowance will be
    payable for the duration of your Jobseeker’s Benefit entitlement (that
    is, either 9 or 12 months).
          </li>
         </ul>

           Civil and public service
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          A ban on recruitment and promotion in the civil and public service was
announced on 27 March 2009. Numbers will further be reduced by measures which
include:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           An early retirement scheme for civil and public servants aged 50 or over
    (from 1 May 2009)
          </li>
          <li>
           Civil servants taking a 3-year career break before 1 September 2009 will
    receive payment of one-third of a year’s salary (up to €12,500) per
    year over the 3 years.
          </li>
          <li>
           A new Shorter Working Year Scheme will replace the Term Time Leave Scheme
    for civil servants
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          The Government is to consider extending the new career break and shorter
working week schemes to the wider public service.
         </p>
         <p>
          Staff in the civil service will also be allocated and redeployed to areas of
highest priority.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           TDs and Senators
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          The Government has decided to introduce a number of additional changes to
the remuneration of Deputies and Senators.
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           10% reduction in all expenses other than mileage rates, which have
    already been reduced by 25%.
          </li>
          <li>
           Deputies will no longer receive long service payments or increments.
          </li>
          <li>
           Former Ministers will no longer be paid Ministerial pensions while they
    are still members of the Oireachtas
          </li>
          <li>
           Oireachtas members who are on paid leave of absence as teachers may no
    longer keep the difference between their teacher's salary and the cost of
    employing a replacement.
          </li>
          <li>
           The allowances paid to Oireachtas Committee chairs will be halved and the
    payments to whips and vice-chairs are to be abolished.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          The Oireachtas Commission has also put forward proposals for a reduction in
the number of Oireachtas Committees
         </p>
         <p>
          The Taoiseach announced on 7 April 2009 that the number of Ministers of
State will be reduced from 20 to 15.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Public sector pay review
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          The Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector is undertaking a
new review of top level pay, to be completed by July 2009. It is expected that
salary rates will be benchmarked against those in other EU states.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Indications of further tax measures
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          Options for future measures may include the taxation of Child Benefit, the
introduction of a carbon tax, a form of property tax, elimination of
unnecessary reliefs and a review of all areas of tax-exempt incomes. The
Government intends to broaden the tax base in future budgets.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Commission on Taxation is examining various aspects of pension tax
treatment including the treatment of lump sums.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Indications of further social welfare measures
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          Child Benefit may be means-tested or taxed.
         </p>
         <p>
          While social welfare rates will not be reduced this year, they may be
reviewed in future years if there are reductions in the cost of living.
         </p>
         <p>
          The campaign against welfare fraud will be intensified by allocating
increased staff to the Department of Social and Family Affairs. It will target,
in particular, fraudulent claims for Child Benefit and other payments by people
who are no longer resident in Ireland.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Capital revenue
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          The Government will look at introducing a national infrastructure bond to
raise money for capital projects.
