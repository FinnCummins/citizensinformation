          Education system
         </h3>
         <p>
          The Irish education system is made up of primary, second-level, third-level
and further education. Children can attend primary school from the age of 4. To
attend second-level they must be aged 12 on 1 January in the first school year
of attendance.
         </p>
         <p>
          There is also an
          <a href="/en/education/pre-school-education-and-childcare/early-childhood-care-and-education-scheme/">
           Early
Childhood Care and Education Scheme
          </a>
          for children of pre-school age. To be
eligible for the scheme they must be at least 2 years and 8 months of age.
         </p>
         <h3>
          School attendance
         </h3>
         <p>
          Attendance at school (or receiving an education) is compulsory from the age
of 6 up to age 16 or until students have completed 3 years of second-level
education, whichever is the later.
         </p>
         <p>
          There is no compulsory

           Tusla - the Child and Family
Agency
          </a>
          is the national agency established to ensure that every child
attends school regularly, or otherwise receives an appropriate minimum
education. The Board:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Monitors school attendance, and takes a range of measures where children
    do not attend school
          </li>
          <li>
           Maintains a register of children who are not attending a recognised
    school
          </li>
          <li>
           Maintains a register of children aged 16 and 17 who leave school early to
    take up employment and makes arrangements for their continuing education
    and training in consultation with providers and employers
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Parents and guardians have a legal obligation to ensure that their child
attends a school or otherwise receives an education. If Tusla considers that
the parents are failing in their obligation, it sends the parents a School
Attendance Notice warning and if the parents fail to comply, they may be
prosecuted. Further information is available in our document on

          it is a
criminal offence to engage or attempt to engage in a sexual act with a child
under 17 years of age. It is not a defence to show that the child consented to
the sexual act. However, the

          recognises the reality of under age,
consensual, peer relationships through the introduction of a ‘proximity of
age’ defence. Under this provision, a person charged with an offence of
engaging in a sexual act with a person between the ages of 15 and 17 years can
use consent as a defence if the person charged is younger or is less than two
years older. They must not be in authority over the child or be intimidatory or

must be at least 18 years old and ordinarily resident in Ireland at the time of
making the application.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you are 16 or 17 years old, you can apply to be included in the 'pending
elector list' but you are not entitled to vote until you reach 18, at which
point you will automatically be added to the Register of Electors. In the event
that an election is called, if you are included in the pending elector list you
will be included in the Register of Electors in force for that election even if
you turn 18 on polling day.
         </p>

          The pending elector list is not part of the register, and it is not

          Beneficial contracts of service usually involve contracts for

money.

         <p>
          Accounts for secondary school students usually offer ATM cards or debit
cards, but you have to keep the account in credit at all times. They do not
offer an overdraft facility and there is a limit to how much you can withdraw.
Usually you do not have to pay transaction fees and charges.

          When opening an account each provider has different procedures. Some
providers require that a parent or guardian sign the account opening form if
you are under 16 years of age. Other providers only require parental permission
if you are under 13 years of age.
