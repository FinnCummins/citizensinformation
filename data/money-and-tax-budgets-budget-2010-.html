          The main Budget changes which may affect people living in Ireland are set
out below.
         </p>
         <p>
          This document sets out changes in the areas of social welfare, tax, health,
transport, environment, housing, education, employment and other areas.
         </p>
         <p>
          Some of the changes announced in the Budget come into effect immediately.
Others take effect from the beginning of January 2010. Many others have to be
finalised before coming into effect. Some elements of these measures may change
when the Finance Bill is published – this is expected in early February 2010.
         </p>
         <p>

         <p>
          From 2011 a new Universal Social Contribution will replace employee PRSI,
the health levy and the income levy. It will be paid by everyone at a low rate
on a wide base as a collective contribution to public services. (Note, 8
December 2010: a Universal Social Charge will be introduced from 1 January 2011
which replaces the income levy and the health levy only.)

          Treatment Benefit

         <p>
          The Treatment Benefit Scheme will be restricted to the medical and surgical
appliances scheme, free dental examinations and free eyesight examinations.

          Rent Supplement and Mortgage Interest Supplement
         </h3>
         <p>
          Rent Supplement: there is no change to the minimum rent contribution.
However, there will be a review of maximum rent levels in 2010.
         </p>
         <p>
          A review of the operation of the Mortgage Interest Supplement Scheme will be
completed early in 2010.

          Restriction of reliefs
         </h3>
         <p>
          The restriction of income tax relief for high income earners* is being
amended for 2010 and subsequent tax years to achieve an effective rate of
income tax of 30% for people who were subject to the full restriction. PRSI and
relevant levies will also apply. The entry level threshold for the restriction
will now occur at adjusted income levels of €125,000 (was €250,000) and the
full restriction will apply at €400,000 (was €500,000).
         </p>
         <p>
          *This restriction of relief measure was introduced in Budget 2006, and came
into operation from 1 January 2007. It limits the use of tax breaks by those
with high incomes. It is based on restricting the amount of specified reliefs
which a person can use to reduce their tax bill in any one year.

          Employers and self-employed
         </h3>
         <ul>
          <li>
           €36m will be allocated to an Employers Job Incentive Scheme giving PRSI
    exemption to encourage employers to take on employees. This will bring the
    total places available for the unemployed to over 180,000.
          </li>
          <li>
           The existing scheme providing a three-year exemption from tax on the
    income and gains of new start-up companies will be extended to include
    companies who commence trading in 2010.
          </li>
          <li>
           A credit review system will examine the credit policies and practices of
    the banks for all SME sectors. It will pay particular attention to sectors
    such as tourism where particular stresses have been reported.
          </li>
          <li>
           Under the Employer Jobs (PRSI) Incentive Scheme, where an employer
    creates a new job and takes on a person who has been unemployed for 6
    months or more, the employer will be fully exempted from the liability to
    pay PRSI for the first year of that employment. This will give employers an
    8%-10% saving on employment costs for each new job created. Full details
    will be announced early in 2010.

          Public service salaries will be reduced as follows:
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Salaries less than €125,00 per year

         <p>
          This produces overall reductions in salaries ranging from 5% to just under
8% for salaries up to €125,000.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>

          These reductions are in line with the recommendations of a recent report of
the Review Body on Higher Remuneration.
         </p>
         <p>
          The salaries of Ministers and Secretaries General of Government departments
will be reduced by 15%. The Taoiseach’s salary will be reduced by 20%.

          Pensions
         </h3>
         <p>
          A new single scheme will be introduced for all new entrants to the public
service from 2010 onwards. Main provisions include:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Raising of the minimum public service pension age from 65 to 66 years
    initially, and then to be linked with the State Pension age
          </li>
          <li>
           Maximum retirement age of 70 years
          </li>
          <li>
           Pensions to be based on “career average” earnings rather than final
    salary
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Legislation will be introduced early in 2010 to give effect to these
measures.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Government will consider using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as the
basis for post-retirement increases for both existing and future pensioners.
         </p>
         <p>
          For existing public servants retiring after 2010, the Minister may bring
forward further proposals as part of the legislation introducing the single new
scheme.
         </p>
         <p>
          In developing the new scheme the Government will be considering:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Employee pension contribution - the rate of employee pension contribution
    remains at 6.5% but may apply to all pensionable pay
          </li>
          <li>
           Pension accrual rate applying to pensionable pay taking account of
    entitlement to a State Pension
          </li>
          <li>
           Some groups, such as Gardaí, Defence Forces, prison officers and
    firefighters will retain early retirement ages but other special terms,
    such as added years, will be generally discontinued
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          These terms to apply to the President, Oireachtas members, the judiciary and
the Attorney General.
         </p>
         <p>
          Any retirements in 2010 will be on existing pay terms before the reductions
announced in this Budget.

          National Solidarity Bond
         </h1>
         <p>
          A new National Solidarity Bond is proposed to help the financing of the
capital investment programme underlying the 2010 Budget (that is, the bond will
not be used to fund additional spending).
         </p>
         <p>
          The bond will be in addition to the current range of “State Savings”
products (savings bonds, savings certificates, prize bonds, national instalment
savings and the Post Office deposit account).
         </p>
         <p>
          The main features of the new bond will be:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Investors can choose to invest for a five-, seven- or ten-year period
          </li>
          <li>
           Interest will be paid annually
          </li>
          <li>
           Investors will be entitled to a final redemption bonus on maturity as an
    incentive to leave their funds invested; the bonus will be different for
    each investment period
          </li>
          <li>
           Full details of the tax treatment of the bond will be provided in the
    Finance Bill 2010
          </li>
          <li>
           It will be possible to invest in the bond by lump sum or by occasional
    payments
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          The bond will be available through the following channels:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Internet
          </li>
          <li>
           Telephone
          </li>
          <li>
           Direct debit
          </li>
          <li>
           At your local Post Office
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          The bond will be sold by An Post on behalf of the National Treasury
Management Agency (NTMA). Further details will be announced by the NTMA early
in 2010.
