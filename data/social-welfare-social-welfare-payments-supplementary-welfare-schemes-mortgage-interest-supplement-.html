          Mortgage Interest Supplement (MIS) provides short-term
support to help you pay your mortgage interest repayments.
          <strong>
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Since 1 January 2014, the Mortgage Interest Supplement scheme has
been closed to new entrants
          </strong>
          <strong>
           and no new applications have been
accepted since this date.
          </strong>
          This did not affect people who were getting
Mortgage Interest Supplement before 1 January 2014.
         </p>
         <p>
          The scheme was wound down for these claimants over a 4-year period and it
closed on 31 December 2017. However, claimants who were getting MIS payments
that were due to end on that date
          <strong>
           continue to receive payments under
the Supplementary Welfare Scheme from 1 January 2018
          </strong>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          The amount you get is equal to the MIS payment that you were getting prior
to 31 December 2017. This payment is made automatically and there is no need to
re-apply to the Department of Social Protection.

           The Mortgage Interest Supplement (MIS) scheme has been closed to new
entrants since 1 January 2014
          </strong>
          and is being wound down for existing
recipients over a 4-year period. However, claimants getting MIS payments that
were due to end on that date, continue to receive payments under the
Supplementary Welfare Scheme from 1 January 2018.

          Information for claimants getting MIS before 1 January 2014
         </h4>
         <p>
          Your interest is assessed as your gross monthly interest less

           mortgage
interest relief
          </a>

          payable towards the interest part of your mortgage by the local
authority.
         </p>
         <p>
          You will only get assistance with the interest portion of your mortgage
repayments. You will not get help with the portion that pays off the actual
loan and house insurance. You should contact your lender to discuss repaying
the actual loan. If you have a consolidated loan, only the interest portion of
your loan that relates to the essential purchase, repair or maintenance of your
home will be taken into account.
         </p>
         <p>
          The minimum contribution for couples towards Mortgage Interest Supplement
increased from €35 to €40 per week (since 1 January 2014). This change
applies to new and existing recipients. The minimum contribution for single
people, including single people with children (currently €30), has not
changed.
         </p>
         <p>
          To qualify for Mortgage Interest Supplement you must meet the following
conditions:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           You must have made an application before 1 January 2014
          </li>
          <li>
           You must satisfy the means test
          </li>
          <li>
           You must have entered into and complied with an alternative repayment
    arrangement with your mortgage lender for at least 12 months
          </li>
          <li>
           You must have been able to afford the repayments when your loan agreement
    was first agreed
          </li>
          <li>
           The amount of your mortgage interest payable is not more than what the
    Department considers reasonable to meet your residential and other
  needs*
          </li>
          <li>
           Only the portion of your loan that relates to the essential purchase,
    repair or maintenance of your home is taken into account
          </li>
          <li>
           The size of the arrears are not greater than what the Department
    considers reasonable
          </li>

          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          *In exceptional circumstances, the Department’s representative may award a
supplement where the amount of mortgage interest payable by a person exceeds
the amount the Department’s representative considers reasonable to meet his
or her residential and other needs. This supplement is payable for a maximum of
12 months from the date of the claim.
         </p>
         <p>
          You can get MIS if your house is for sale. This means that people can engage
in selling their home and continue to be eligible for MIS, subject to the other
conditions of the MIS scheme.
         </p>
         <p>
          You won’t qualify for Mortgage Interest Supplement if:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           You or your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant works more than 29 hours
    a week (for exceptions to this rule - see ‘Employment and Mortgage
    Interest Supplement' below)
          </li>
          <li>
           You are involved in a trade dispute
          </li>
          <li>
           You are attending full-time education (for exceptions to this rule - see

          </li>
          <li>
           You have made an application for international protection and your
    application is awaiting final decision by the Minister for Justice and
    Equality
          </li>
          <li>
           You have made an application under the Aliens Act, 1935 to remain in the
    State and this application has not been determined
          </li>
          <li>
           You are admitted to an institution (for example, a hospital) for a period
    of in excess of 13 weeks
          </li>
         </ul>
         <h3>
          Employment and Mortgage Interest Supplement
         </h3>
         <p>
          You will not qualify for Mortgage Interest Supplement if you are in
full-time employment. That is, employment for 29 hours per week or more. (In
the case of couples, if one of a couple is in full time employment, both are
excluded from claiming Mortgage Interest Supplement). However, there are
          <strong>
           special retention arrangements
          </strong>
          that may allow you to keep a
proportion of your Mortgage Interest Supplement - for example, if you are
participating in a
          <a href="/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-schemes/community-employment-scheme/">
           Community
Employment Scheme
          </a>
          or getting
          <a href="/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/social-welfare-payments-and-work/back-to-work-enterprise-allowance/">
           Back
to Work Enterprise Allowance
          </a>
          . Your gross household income must not exceed
€317.43 per week. Back to Work Enterprise Allowance,
          <a href="/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/social-welfare-payments-to-families-and-children/family-income-supplement/">
           Working
Family Payment (WFP),
          </a>

           PRSI
          </a>
          ,
reasonable travel expenses and any childcare allowance payable on certain
training courses is not taken into account in the assessment of your gross
household income.
         </p>
         <p>
          Under these special retention arrangements you will continue to get 75% of
your Mortgage Interest Supplement rate during your first year in employment,
50% in the second year and 25% in the third and fourth year. After the fourth
year you will no longer be entitled to Mortgage Interest Supplement if you are
in employment.
         </p>
         <p>
          These retention arrangements also apply to people who have been unemployed
for 12 months or more and who return to full-time employment and sign off their
social welfare payment. In these cases gross household income must not exceed
€317.43 per week.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Education and Mortgage Interest Supplement
         </h3>
         <p>
          You won’t qualify for Mortgage Interest Supplement if you are attending
full-time education. However, if you are getting Mortgage Interest Supplement
and qualify for the
          <a href="/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/back-to-education/back-to-education-allowance/">
           Back to
Education Allowance (BTEA)

          , you will keep an entitlement to Mortgage
Interest Supplement.

          When you apply for Mortgage Interest Supplement your means will be assessed.
This will show how much of the mortgage interest you are able to pay. A means
test examines all your sources of income. However, some income is not taken
into account in the calculation of your means. You may qualify for Mortgage
Interest Supplement if your income is below a certain amount and you meet the
other conditions - see 'Rules' above.

          You must pay at least €30 towards your mortgage interest. You may pay more
than €30 because you must also contribute any means you have towards your
mortgage interest. If you are one of a couple and are claiming Mortgage
Interest Supplement you must pay at least €40 towards your mortgage interest.

          </br>
         </h3>
         <p>
          Calculating your Mortgage Interest Supplement can be difficult. The
Community Welfare Officer (CWO) decides whether you are eligible for Mortgage
Interest Supplement and calculates the amount you get.
         </p>
         <p>
          The CWO adds together any income taken into account in the means test for
Mortgage Interest Supplement. They then subtract any income not taken into
account. Your remaining income and Household Contribution are added together to
find your contribution to your mortgage interest - see 'Means test' above.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Mortgage Interest Supplement payable to you is the difference between
your actual mortgage interest and your contribution to mortgage interest, as
long as the difference between the two is a reasonable amount to meet your
residential needs.
         </p>
         <p>
          Generally the CWO will ensure that your income after paying the interest on
your mortgage does not fall below a minimum level. This level is the
Supplementary Welfare Allowance minus €30 (€40 for couples).

          All existing Mortgage Interest Supplement claims in payment on 5 June 2007
will be reviewed and assessed using both the current income disegards and the
old income disregards. If you would get more Mortgage Interest Supplement using
the old income disregards, you will continue to be assessed using the old rules
until a change in circumstances triggers a review. A change in circumstances
would include, for example, a change in household income or a break in your
claim for more than 13 weeks.
