          If you are a citizen of the European Union (EU), you have the right to live and
work in any other EU country. In general, you and your dependents cannot be
refused permission to land in another EU country. You may need a valid identity
card or passport. If your family are not citizens of the EU or EEA, they may
need a visa before travelling.
         </p>
         <p>
          You may be refused entry, and/or your right of residence in another member
state may be restricted on grounds of public policy, public security, or public
health.
         </p>
         <p>
          The rights outlined here broadly apply to non-EU States in the European
Economic Area, that is, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, and to
Switzerland.
         </p>
         <p>
          if you are an Irish Citizen you can live and work in the UK under the

          If you are an EU citizen moving to another EU country to take up employment or
self-employment or to provide a service,

           EU
Directives on the free movement of workers
          </a>
          cover you. Members of your
family, whatever their nationality, have the right to accompany you or to join
you in your country of employment.
         </p>
         <p>
          Your ‘qualifying’ family is:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Your spouse or civil partner
          </li>
          <li>
           Your child or the child of your spouse under the age of 21
          </li>
          <li>
           Your grandchild or your spouse’s grandchild under the age of 21
          </li>
          <li>
           Your dependent parent, or dependent parent of your spouse
          </li>
          <li>
           Your dependent grandparent, or the dependent grandparent of your
  spouse
          </li>
          <li>
           Other direct, dependent descendants or direct, dependent relatives in the
    ascending line (for example, great grandparents or great grandchildren) of
    either you or your spouse
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Children over 21 are generally considered qualifying family members if they
are in education, or are dependent on you due to an illness or disability. You
will have to show that your parents or grandparents (or the parents or
grandparents of your spouse) were dependent on you before they came to
Ireland.
         </p>
         <p>
          Other family members do not have an absolute right of residence, but may be
permitted to live with you in another EU country. Permitted family
members
          <strong>
          </strong>
          include:
          <strong>
          </strong>
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Your partner
          </li>
          <li>
           Any relative who is part of your household that is not a qualifying
    family member
          </li>
          <li>
           Any relative who needs your personal care because of illness or
  disability
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          EU citizens exercising their right to free movement do not need a residence
card but family members who are not EU citizens may need one.
         </p>
         <p>
          If they wish to, your spouse, civil partner and children also have the right
to work without restriction in your country of employment. You and your family
members have the right to the same social benefits as citizens of the host
member state. This includes the right to access education and benefits.
         </p>
         <p>
          Members of your family who come from a non-EU country may be asked for an
entry visa by the country you are working in. This visa is granted quite easily
and should be free of charge.

          You can work under the same conditions as citizens of the country where you
are looking for work. You cannot be asked to meet any additional requirements.
This means that you can apply for any job vacancy advertised in any EU country,
including public sector jobs. However, certain public service posts may be
restricted to citizens of a particular country if the job involves safeguarding
public order or the interests of the state, for example, the armed forces and
police.

          Recognition of qualifications in the EU
         </h3>
         <p>
          The EU has set up
          <a href="http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/professional-qualifications/index_en.htm">
           systems
for recognising diplomas and training
          </a>
          so you can use your training and
skills in another EU country. The basic principle is that if you are qualified
to exercise a profession in your home country, you are qualified to exercise
the same profession in any other EU country.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Professional qualifications
         </h3>
         <p>
          A general system of
          <a href="/en/returning-to-ireland/starting-work/Recognition-of-professional-qualifications-in-ireland/">
           recognition
of qualifications to work
          </a>
          in most regulated professions is in place across
the EU. If you wish to work in a profession (as a teacher, lawyer, engineer or
psychologist, for example) that is regulated in the country of employment, you
must apply for recognition of your qualifications in that country. The
authorities have 4 months in which to reply. If they consider that your
training is significantly different in terms of duration or content from the
training in the host country, you may be asked to get either additional
professional experience, or to take a training course or to take an aptitude
test.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you are a doctor, a general nurse, a dentist, a midwife, a vet, a
pharmacist or an architect, your national qualifications are in principle
recognised automatically.
         </p>
         <p>
          If your profession is not regulated in the country in which you wish to
work, formal recognition of your qualifications is not needed.

           EURES network
          </a>
          was established by the European Commission to help European citizens looking
for work in another country in the EU/EEA. EURES has a network of advisers,
known as EURES advisers, who can give you general practical information on
legislation, social security, living conditions, useful addresses, information
on pay levels, taxes, contracts, recruitment practices, and other
information.
         </p>
         <p>
          EURES advisors have access to the EURES job vacancies database with
vacancies in the EU/EEA. If you are interested in working or seeking work
within the EU/EEA, you should make an appointment with your nearest EURES
advisor. Contact

          If you are unemployed, you have the right to live in another EU country for
a "reasonable period" of time in order to look for a job. In the absence of a
definition of "reasonable period", most EU countries are now operating a
6-month period, though some EU countries are still operating a 3-month period.
         </p>
         <p>
          However, no matter how long it takes you to find a job, you cannot be asked
to leave the country if you can prove that you are genuinely looking for a job
and that you have a real chance of finding one. For example, if you still have
interviews or tests to attend.
         </p>
         <p>
          You can register at employment agencies and centres without being resident
in the country in which you wish to work and you will be given the same help to
find work as nationals of that country.

          <a href="/en/moving-country/moving-abroad/leaving-ireland/leaving-ireland-and-your-social-security-entitlements/">
           you
may continue to get the payment from that same country for up to 13 weeks after
you move to another member state.
          </a>
          You must have been getting the payment
for at least 4 weeks before you can transfer it to another country.

          If you

           apply
to transfer your benefit
          </a>
          it will be paid directly to you. You must still
register with the employment services of the country where you have gone to
look for work within a week. Also you may transfer your benefit more than once
while you are unemployed provided you do not exceed the maximum period of 13
weeks. If you do not find work, you must return to the first country within 3
months, otherwise you lose your right to unemployment benefit.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you are leaving Ireland to move to Northern Ireland or Britain your
Social Welfare Local Office will issue you with the Form U2 (formerly Form
E303) which you take to the UK social services. If you are moving to another EU
country, the Department of Social Protection will send the U2 form to your new
address in that EU country.

          Employment rights
         </h3>
         <p>
          All EU nationals working in another EU country have the right to live there.
You do not need a residence permit. You have the same working conditions as
citizens of the country you are working in, including pay, dismissal, hours of
work, discrimination, maternity leave and health and safety at work.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Social security

           aim
of EU policy is to ensure that you are part of a social security system
          </a>
          and
that you do not lose your rights, regardless of the member state you decide to
work in.
         </p>
         <p>
          In principle, you are insured for social security purposes in the country
you work in. You, and in certain circumstances, your family are entitled to the
same social security benefits as citizens of the country in which you work.
These rights cover sickness and maternity benefits, disability, old-age and
survivor's benefits, benefits for accidents at work, occupational illness,
death and unemployment, as well as family allowances. You have to pay the same
level of contributions as host country citizens. You cannot be excluded from
benefits on grounds of nationality, for reasons of residence, or for any other
discriminatory reason.

         <h3>
          Taxes
         </h3>
         <p>
          If you live and work in another member state, you are likely to become
"resident for tax purposes" there. Each country has its own definition of tax
residence. You must comply with the laws of the country you are resident in.
You may be liable for taxation in more than one country. In general, you are
subject to income tax in the country you live in but this may not be the case
if you are a “posted worker” – see below. In general, property is taxed
in the country in which it is situated but, again, there are variations.
         </p>
         <p>
          Tax agreements intended to avoid double taxation if you get income from
different countries are in place between most of the member states of the
EU.
         </p>
         <p>
          In general, national fiscal rules must respect the fundamental principle of
non-discrimination against nationals of another EU country.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Workers posted to another EU country
         </h3>
         <p>
          You have certain specific rights if you are
          <a href="http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/work-abroad/posted-workers/index_en.htm">
           a
posted worker
          </a>
          , which means that you work for a limited period of time in a
member state that is not the one where you normally work. If you are posted for
more than a month, your employer must inform you in writing, before you leave,
of your pay and working conditions while you are abroad.
         </p>
         <p>
          You usually remain affiliated to the social security system of your country
of origin. You may pay income tax in that country as well but the situation
varies between member states. You can

         <h3>
          Freedom to provide services
         </h3>
         <p>
          You may choose to offer your services in another EU country without
establishing yourself there permanently. If you comply with the rules of the
profession or trade that apply in your own country, you can offer those
services anywhere else in the EU. You can travel to assist clients located in
another EU country or you can provide paid services from your country of
residence without travelling there.

          (also known as a cross-border or frontier worker) if you live in
one EU country but work in another and you go home at least once a week. As a
cross-border worker, you must be treated in the same way as an employee who is
a national of the country of employment as regards the right to apply for jobs,
working conditions and social benefits.
         </p>
         <p>
          Therefore, the general rule is that you pay social security contributions in
the member state where you are employed and you are subject to the legislation
of that state even if you live in another member state.
         </p>
         <p>
          With regard to benefits, generally you get short-term benefits from the
country where you last paid insurance and long-term benefits proportionately
from all the countries in which you paid insurance.
         </p>
         <p>
          For cross-border workers, the rule on unemployment benefit is:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           During partial or intermittent unemployment, you get your benefit from
    your country of employment
          </li>
          <li>
           During periods of full unemployment, you get your benefit from your
    country of residence.

          You are a posted worker if your employer sends you to work in another
country on a temporary basis. The period of the posting is a maximum period of
24 months. If you are posted to another EEA state or Switzerland you have
certain rights as follows:
         </p>
         <h3>
          Social insurance
         </h3>
         <p>
          As a posted worker you generally will continue to pay your social security
contributions in Ireland. You should apply for an A1 (formerly E101)
certificate which states that you are insured for social security purposes in
Ireland. This will exempt you and your employer from paying social insurance in
the country to which you are posted. At least 4 weeks before you leave you or
your employer should apply for the AI certificate. You can download the
          <a href="https://assets.gov.ie/69405/aa0f059f16814282915b065bb64dfe38.pdf">
