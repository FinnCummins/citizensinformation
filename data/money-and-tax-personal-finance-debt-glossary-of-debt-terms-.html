          Bankruptcy
         </h3>
         <p>
          Bankruptcy is a settlement of the debts of someone who is wholly or
partially unable to repay their debts. It deals with both
          <strong>
           secured
          </strong>
          and
          <strong>

          debt.
         </p>
         <p>
          The purpose of the bankruptcy is to distribute your assets fairly among your
          <strong>
           creditors
          </strong>
          and protect you from these
          <strong>
           creditors
          </strong>
          . The distribution is done through a court official,
the Official Assignee in Bankruptcy.

          Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA)
         </h3>
         <p>
          The CCMA is a statutory code, issued by the Central Bank of Ireland, which
requires mortgage lenders to adopt specific procedures when dealing with
borrowers who are facing
          <strong>
           mortgage arrears
          </strong>
          . Under this Code,

         <h3>
          Consolidation Loan
         </h3>
         <p>
          A consolidation loan is a new, single loan that combines (consolidates) more
than one outstanding debt. For example, a consolidation loan could combine your
credit card debt, mortgage or rent arrears, loan repayments and household bills
into one monthly payment.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Consumer credit agreements
         </h3>
         <p>
          A consumer credit agreement is a document that records the terms and
conditions of an agreement between a
          <strong>
           creditor
          </strong>
          (lender) and a
          <strong>
           debtor
          </strong>
          (borrower), where the borrower is a consumer.
         </p>
         <p>
          The rules on consumer credit agreements apply to almost all credit
agreements, hire-purchase agreements and consumer-hire agreements. They apply
to agreements to borrow money which you make with banks, building societies,
moneylenders and certain other finance companies. They do not apply to
agreements to borrow money from credit unions, pawnbrokers and utility service
providers or to agreements entered into by businesses.
         </p>
         <p>
          Agreements covered by the

           enforceable
          </a>
          . The legislation
provides that it is an offence for a
          <strong>
           creditor
          </strong>
          to demand
payment if the agreement is not enforceable.

         <h3>
          Contracts
         </h3>
         <p>
          In a debt context, a contract is an agreement by one party to provide goods
or services for another in return for payment. In general, contracts do not
have to be in writing in order to be enforceable. However, contracts for the
sale of land and contracts governed by the
          <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/act/pub/0024/index.html">
           Consumer
Credit Act 1995
          </a>
          must be in writing in order to be enforceable.
         </p>
         <p>
          Failure to pay is a breach of the contract. Contracts may include penalty
clauses for failure to meet the terms of the contract. So, for example, the
contract may provide that you must pay an extra charge or you must pay interest
if you fail to pay on time.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Court judgment
         </h3>
         <p>
          In this context, a Court judgment states that you owe a debt. That judgment
can then be
          <a href="/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/enforcement-of-judgments/">

history.
         </p>
         <p>
          Your credit report is available for lenders to consult when they are
considering a loan application. It is used to help lenders assess the ability
of borrowers to repay any future debts.

          Creditor
         </h3>
         <p>
          The creditor is the person (or company) to whom you owe money. This person
is known as the
          <em>
           judgment creditor
          </em>
          if judgment is awarded against you
in court.

         <h3>
          Debt forbearance and forgiveness
         </h3>
         <p>
          <em>
           Debt forbearance
          </em>
          is the term that is sometimes used by
          <strong>
           creditors
          </strong>
          when they agree to allow you to change the manner in
which your debt will be repaid, for example, by postponing some payments or by
restructuring the manner in which repayments are made. You continue to owe all
the money and you will eventually have to repay it all.
         </p>
         <p>
          <em>
           Debt forgiveness
          </em>
          or cancellation occurs when your
          <strong>
           creditor
          </strong>
          decides not to pursue the debt. Permanent debt
forgiveness is rare. Some
          <strong>
           creditors
          </strong>
          may cease to pursue the
debt because they recognise that you will never be able to repay it but that
does not mean that the debt is forgiven or cancelled. If your circumstances
change, you may still be pursued for it.

          The Debt Settlement Arrangement applies to the agreed settlement of
          <em>

          debts, usually over a period of 5 years. (See

increase to 6 years in some situations. When the DSA concludes successfully,
the debts that it covers will be fully discharged and the debtor will be

          Debtor
         </h3>
         <p>
          You are a debtor if you owe money to someone. If a court judgment is awarded
against you, you are now a
          <em>
           judgment debtor

          Debts and criminal offences
         </h3>
         <p>
          Most debts arise because you have failed to meet the terms of a contract.
For example, you borrow money from the bank or credit union and you fail to pay
it back, or you enter into an agreement to buy equipment by instalments and you
fail to pay. It is a breach of contract to fail to pay such debts - it is not
generally a criminal offence.
         </p>
         <p>
          However, it is a criminal offence to fail to pay certain debts. For example,
it is an offence not to pay your taxes or your TV licence fee. You may be
charged and convicted for failure to pay such debts. Even if you are charged,
convicted and fined, you still owe the debt and can be sued for it in the
normal way.

          The term
          <em>
           priority debt
          </em>
          can be used in a general sense but it can
also have a specific legal meaning. If you owe money to a number of
          <strong>
           creditors
          </strong>
          , you have your own view of which of these debts take
priority. Most people would regard the repayments on their home as taking
priority over the repayment of other loans.

          The legal meaning of
          <em>
           priority debt
          </em>
          may be different. For example,
in receiverships, liquidations and
          <strong>
           bankruptcy
          </strong>
          , the law sets
out the order in which the debts must be paid.

         <h3>
          Protective certificate

         <p>
          This is a certificate issued by a court to protect the debtor against legal
proceedings by a creditor in respect of debts while a

debt problems. Reasonable living expenses is a term used by the Insolvency
Service of Ireland (ISI) to refer to the amount of money needed for you and
your household to have a reasonable standard of living. This minimum standard
of living allows for expenses such as food, clothing, health, education,
transport, childcare and insurance.

          Repayment arrangement
         </h3>
         <p>
          A repayment arrangement is a voluntary agreement between a
          <strong>
           debtor
          </strong>
          and one or more of their
          <strong>
           creditors
          </strong>
          ,
about how they will repay their debt. It is sometimes called an alternative
repayment arrangement (ARA) or a debt repayment plan. In the case of debt, a
repayment arrangement is usually voluntarily made with your
          <strong>
           creditors
          </strong>
          to repay a debt in fixed amounts over a certain time
period, and depends on your abilty to pay. You should get all arrangements in
writing and keep copies for your records. Let your
          <strong>
           creditors
          </strong>
          know if you cannot keep up the repayments as agreed, as you may be able to
renegotiate the terms of your arrangement.

          Repossess

provider takes over a person’s home because they have failed to pay back
their mortgage on time).

         <h3>
          Secured loan
         </h3>
         <p>
          This is a loan on which property or goods are available as security against
non-payment. Mortgages are the most common secured loans. Sometimes, business
loans and other loans are also secured against property.
         </p>
         <p>
          In general, debts such as bank loans and credit card debt are
          <strong>
           unsecured
          </strong>
          . However, if you decide to roll up such loans into
your mortgage, they now become
          <strong>
           secured loans
          </strong>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          If the property or goods on which the security is based are subsequently
sold, the secured loan must be paid off before the proceeds can be used for any
other purposes.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Simple contract debt
         </h3>
         <p>
          This is a debt which arises because you have not paid for goods or services
which are not covered by any special rules. For example, if you buy goods using
a cheque and the cheque is not honoured, there is a simple contract debt to the
seller. If you use the services of a plumber and do not pay him, there is a
simple contract debt to the plumber. The seller or the plumber can go to court
to get judgment against you and then enforce that judgment.
         </p>
         <p>
          A range of legislation provides that various fees and levies which have not
been paid may be dealt with in court in the same way as simple contract
debts.

           enforce debt judgments.
          </a>
          Sheriffs
can collect outstanding debts from you by seizing your property or goods.
Sheriffs operate in counties Cork and Dublin. County Registrars enforce debt
judgments in all other places. Sheriffs are paid for their enforcement work on
a commission basis.
         </p>
         <p>
          As well as County Sheriffs in Cork and Dublin, Revenue Sheriffs enforce
debts owed to the Revenue Commissioners. They have the power to collect tax
debts. They can do this on the basis of a certificate of liability issued by
the Collector General and do not need a court order. Revenue debts can also be
collected in the normal way if there is a court order.

           Statute of
Limitations 1957
          </a>
          , as amended, or in specific legislation dealing with the
court issue involved.
         </p>
         <p>
          The law in relation to time limits is complex but, in general, the time
limit for taking actions for breach of contract (for example, failure to pay
for goods or services provided), for debt judgments and for non-payment of
charges such as rent is 6 years. If your
          <strong>
           creditor
          </strong>
          does not
start the court action within 6 years of the debt being due, the action can be
held to be
          <em>
           statute-barred
          </em>
          by the court. However, you must raise the
fact that the creditor’s action is statute barred and win. If you win, this
effectively means that you cannot be forced by the court to pay the debt even
though the debt still exists.
         </p>
         <p>
          If your
          <strong>
           creditor
          </strong>
          gets a judgment, then, in general, they
have 12 years in which to
          <a href="/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/enforcement-of-judgments/">
           enforce
that judgment
          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <h3>
          Unsecured loan
         </h3>
         <p>
          This is a loan that is not attached to any asset, for example credit card
debt or a personal loan.
         </p>
         <p>
          If a person does not repay their loan, the lender is not allowed take any of
their assets without taking the person to court to get an enforcement order for
the
          <strong>
           Sheriff
          </strong>
          . However, the lender still has a legal right to
recover the debt and can do so by taking the
          <strong>
           debtor
          </strong>
          to
court.
