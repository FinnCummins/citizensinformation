          When you take out a mortgage to buy a property, you offer the property as
security for the mortgage debt. If you are unable to pay the mortgage, you may
be faced with repossession.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you are having difficulties paying your mortgage, you should talk to the
lending institution as soon as possible. Our

home should be the lender's last resort.

         </h3>
         <p>
          Even if you have no mortgage on your home, it could be in danger of
repossession if you have other debts. If you build up other debts and are
unable to repay them then the people to whom you owe money may register that
debt as a judgment mortgage against your house, flat or apartment and seek to
recover their money in that way - see ‘Other debts and loans' below.

          If your home is being repossessed
         </h3>
         <p>
          If you have exhausted all the options open to you, the lender can repossess
your home in order to recover the amount you owe. If you do not agree to the
repossession, the lender may take you to court. The legal processes are
described in detail below.
         </p>

          When your home is to be repossessed, you will need to find somewhere else to

          In 2011, a High Court decision established that there were legal
difficulties with getting orders for possession of certain properties. This
decision was made in a number of cases where mortgage providers were applying
to repossess mortgaged property.
         </p>
         <p>
          Put simply, the decision meant that, in the case of mortgages created before
1 December 2009, it was very difficult for a mortgage provider to get an order
for possession unless the court proceedings were started before that date.
         </p>
         <p>
          This situation arose because the law was changed on 1 December 2009. An
existing law governing repossessions was repealed by the
          <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0027/index.html">
           Land and
Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009
          </a>
          , which provided for repossessions but
applied only to mortgages created after it came into effect.
         </p>

           Land and
Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013
          </a>
          was introduced to remedy the legal
difficulties described above. It also provides for a court to adjourn
repossession proceedings for up to 2 months in certain situations, to allow the
possibility of a

          to be explored as an alternative to
repossession.

          The lending institution must get a court order to repossess or sell your

         </p>
         <p>
          In general, a lending institution may start the proceedings for repossession
in either the Circuit Court or the High Court. However, if the mortgage was
taken out on or after 1 December 2009, then a case for the repossession of the
home arising from default on a housing mortgage loan must be first taken in the
          <a href="/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/">
           Circuit Court
          </a>
          . The
Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013 (described above), has extended this
rule to housing loan mortgages taken out before 1 December 2009. A housing loan
mortgage is the usual kind of mortgage that individuals take out in order to
build, buy or improve a house. (Cases involving repossession for default on
other kinds of mortgages may continue to be taken in either the Circuit or the
High Court.)
         </p>
         <p>
          The usual procedure is that the lending institution applies to the court for
one or more orders – a possession order and/or a well-charging order. These
orders may be granted in the same proceedings. Generally, it is the practice of
the courts to allow you some time to make arrangements to repay the money owed
before making any final orders.
         </p>
         <p>
          If an order for possession or a well-charging order is made against you and
you do not hand over possession or comply with other terms of the orders, the
orders may be
          <a href="/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/enforcement-of-judgments/">
           enforced
          </a>
          by the Sheriff (in Dublin and Cork) or by the County Registrar in other
areas.

          <strong>
           Circuit Court procedure
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          The procedure in the Circuit Court is governed by the Rules of the Circuit
Court as set out in the
          <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/si/0264.html" shape="rect">
           Circuit Court Rules
(Actions for Possession and Wellcharging Relief) 2009
          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          The Circuit Court process starts when the mortgage provider issues you with
a civil bill. This is usually accompanied by an affidavit setting out the claim
that is being made against you. The civil bill has a
          <em>
           return date
          </em>
          –
that is the date on which the matter will come before the County Registrar. The
civil bill must be served on you at least 21 days before the return date.
         </p>
         <p>
          The mortgage provider may apply for a possession order and/or a
well-charging order (see below).
         </p>
         <p>
          If you intend to fight the action taken by the mortgage provider to
repossess your home, you must
          <em>
           enter an appearance
          </em>
          (there is a specific
form for doing this) within 10 days of being served the civil bill. You must
then file an affidavit replying to the mortgage provider’s claim and serve
that on the mortgage provider at least four days before the return date.
         </p>
         <p>
          When your case comes before the County Registrar it will be decided on the
basis of what is in the affidavits. Neither side has the right to give oral
evidence except in specific circumstances. However, you do have the right to
cross examine the person who swore the affidavit. In order to do this, you must
have given notice that you require this person to be present.
         </p>
         <p>
          The County Registrar has the power to make a number of orders, including
adjournments, notice to third parties and more time to file affidavits.

          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          The County Registrar may make an order for possession and/or a well-charging
order if you have
          <strong>
           not
          </strong>
          entered an appearance.
         </p>
         <p>
          The County Registrar can also make an order for possession, if you have
entered an appearance and filed a replying affidavit, but your affidavit does
not disclose a prima facie defence (this means that the affidavit does not show
any obvious defence).
         </p>
         <p>
          If you have entered an appearance and filed a replying affidavit which does
disclose a prima facie defence, the case must be sent by the County Registrar
for hearing by a judge.

          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          The procedures for getting well-charging and possession orders in the High
Court are similar. The Master of the High Court has a similar (but not exactly
the same) role as the County Registrar in the Circuit Court. The procedure is
set out in Order 38 of the Rules of the Superior Courts.
         </p>
         <p>
          The lender may apply to the High Court for a possession order and, if
necessary, a well-charging order.
         </p>
         <p>
          The process involves the lender issuing a special summons. This is first
dealt with by the Master of the High Court. He sets a return date which may not
be less than 7 days after the issuing of the summons. The summons must then be
served on you at least four days before the return date. The lender must file
an affidavit setting out the facts of the claim in the Central Office of the
High Court. The hearing may be on affidavit only or oral evidence may be given.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Master may grant or refuse the orders requested or may forward the case
for hearing by a High Court judge.

           Mortgage suit
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          A
          <em>
           mortgage suit
          </em>
          is a court procedure which is taken by the holder
of a security on property (for example, your mortgage lender) to recover a debt
by forcing a sale of that property. If a mortgage suit is successful, the court
issues a well-charging order. A well-charging order usually includes:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           A declaration by the court that the debt owing to the person or
    institution (together with any interest and costs) taking the case is
    “well charged” on the property in question
          </li>
          <li>
           A direction that the property be sold (usually the court gives you time
    to pay the amount due before the order for sale becomes effective)
          </li>
          <li>
           A direction that the
           <a href="/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/">
            Examiner’s
    Office
           </a>
           take an account of all encumbrances and make an inquiry into
    their respective priorities. This can arise, for example, if you have more
    than one mortgage on a property or there is some arrangement whereby some
    of the proceeds of sale of the house must be used for other purposes
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          The arrangements for the sale are also generally agreed through the
Examiner’s Office. The sale is usually by public auction. If the sale price
is greater than the amount you owe, then the excess is paid over to you. If it
is less, you are still liable to repay the shortfall.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you manage to make a settlement with the lender and agree repayment
terms, then the lender may apply to the court to discharge the well-charging
order.

           Executing the orders
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          If you do not comply with the terms of the court orders, they may be
enforced by the sheriff or the County Registrar.

          If you owe money for any reason and the creditor is trying to get repayment,
one of the options open to the creditor is to create a
          <em>
           judgment
mortgage
          </em>
          on your property (your home or any other property you own). A
judgment mortgage has broadly the same effect as a conventional mortgage on
your home and can be enforced by way of a mortgage suit - see above.
         </p>
         <p>
          First the creditor must get a
          <em>
           judgment order
          </em>
          , and then an
          <em>
           execution order
          </em>
          (usually a
          <em>
           fi fa order
          </em>
          ) and if the execution
order doesn’t result in payment of the debt the creditor may get a judgment
mortgage on your property.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Judgment order
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          The creditor must first get a court to decide that you do owe them money.
This is called a judgment order. To get a judgment order, the creditor will
take their case (make a motion) to the
          <a href="/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/">
           District Court
          </a>
          ,
the Circuit Court or the High Court – which court depends on the amount of
money involved. This motion may, of course, be contested by you (the debtor). A
judgment order is made if it is established that you (the debtor) owe the money
in question.
         </p>
         <p>
          When a judgment for the payment of money is obtained from a court, the
person in whose favour the judgment is given is called a
          <em>
           judgment
creditor
          </em>
          and the person who has to make the payment is a
          <em>
           judgment
debtor
          </em>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          In general, the creditor has 12 years in which to enforce the judgment
order.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Enforcing the judgment order
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          The legal term for enforcing the judgment is
          <em>
           execution
          </em>
          . Having got
a judgment order, the creditor then has to get an order to execute the
judgment. The execution order entitles the creditor to enforce the judgment.
         </p>
         <p>
          A number of different execution orders are available. Generally, execution
orders remain in force for a year but may be renewed.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Fi fa order
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          The execution order most commonly used to enforce a High Court judgment for
a specific amount of money is an order of
          <em>
           fieri facias
          </em>
          (the literal
meaning is “that you cause to be done” and the orders are generally called
orders of
          <em>
           fi fa
          </em>
          ) These orders are issued by the Central Office of the
High Court.
         </p>
         <p>
          This order entitles the creditor to direct the sheriff or County Registrar
(County Registrars fulfil this function in all areas except Dublin and Cork
cities and counties) to seize and sell property belonging to the debtor. If
this fails because there is no property to seize, then the sheriff or County
Registrar reports that no goods could be found to be seized (the legal phrase
is to return the writ
          <em>
           nulla bona
          </em>
          ).
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Judgment mortgage
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          A
          <em>
           judgment mortgage
          </em>
          is frequently created when the order of
          <em>
           fi
fa
          </em>
          fails to deliver any property. The judgment creditor may not look for a
fi fa order at all and may create a judgment mortgage instead. Creating a
judgment mortgage involves registering the judgment as a mortgage against your
property. Effectively, the judgment is converted into a mortgage and this is
registered in the
          <a href="/en/housing/owning-a-home/buying-a-home/property-deeds/">
           Land Registry or
Registry of Deeds
          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          Registration of the judgment mortgage does not have any automatic immediate
effect until the judgment creditor decides either to force a sale or to claim
entitlement to the proceeds of a sale by the judgment debtor.
         </p>
         <p>
          A judgment mortgage has broadly the same effect as a conventional mortgage
and can be enforced by way of a mortgage suit - see above.
