          Disability can be diagnosed at any stage during a child’s development. A
child may be found to have a disability before birth or around the time of
birth. Sometimes a disability may not become apparent until later in your
child's life when they have difficulty learning in school. In some cases
children acquire a disability after an illness or accident.
         </p>
         <p>
          When your child is diagnosed with a disability, it can be an emotional time.

          Often there is nothing to be worried about, and many children catch up in
their own time. If the GP or public health nurse is concerned, they can refer
you to the service your child needs.

          If your child is having difficulties in school, you should speak to their
teacher or school principal. They will advise you on what to do next. This may
include an

Psychological Service (NEPS)

psychologists are not available. Some parents choose private assessments. If
your school arranges an assessment through NEPS, there is no charge for the
assessment.

you, develop a plan of action for providing services. This plan may include
individual and group therapy and supports for families.
